I was newly married and the first item my husband wanted me to learn from his thamma (grandmother) was a dal, masoor dal recipe and thamma was 90+ at that time. She sat on a mura and gave directions and I cooked. One of the best dal I had tasted, dry and slow cooked by adding water every now and then. Thank you Bong eats 🧡🧡🧡"

urF2q-ylC18,"Such a lovely episode this is. Lots of love (from Arundhati and Soumya) to Bong Eats (plus, Ms. Pritha Sen) from Limerick 🇮🇪 Oftentimes we keep getting absolutely amazed by the content’s depth in this channel 🙏😊 Please keep on streaming such great work!"
urF2q-ylC18,I've been waiting for long time for a new episode of this series. Unlike others this one is also lit. What I love about this series is the conversation with the guest during cooking. This time the cooking part is more fascinating than the past ones. So many lovely cuisines in a single episode!!❤
urF2q-ylC18,"So nicely said "" the food habits are not politically bound, they are ethnically and regionally connected""😊😊"

urF2q-ylC18,The richer you get the farther you move away from your roots ❤
urF2q-ylC18,"Very knowledgeable episode it is..I""ll try the khoi bora definitely,❤"
urF2q-ylC18,"Pritha di's description of the influences that has shaped Bengali cuisine down the ages is absolutely correct. Truly Bengali food is the first example of global food as the ingredients and influnces have been absorbed and assimilated from very diverse cultures all over the world and is therefore very unique and also varies from place to place, home to home. Also it is important to understand that Bengali cuisine has an outreach as far as the Bengal Presidency during British era."

11ZPGwN2pVE,"It’s almost like how sambar is made. It has a mix of all vegetables especially the variant we make in Kerala. It’s such a wholesome feel too see all foods are so closely or loosely connected across our country. More like first, 2nd and 3rd cousins 😅"

In this short I noticed that this was instead more akin to the current trends of fast shot changes without lingering on the beauty and sounds. I know its hard to do in a short but what I mean to say is please dont think you need to trade your uniqueness and USP to adhere to the current trend - even in a short Im sure you would find your own special way to demonstrate the beauty of cooking while still keeping it to a few second.

Akqf_8-0jFQ,"I made this today and it was simple and delicious. I obviously (for someone in the US) didn't have the eggplant of the type used in the recipe, so I used the regular Indian baingan available here, although I suspect that Thai eggplant might also work. I cooked the eggplant in the air fryer as opposed to deep frying. The sauce was delicious but I will reduce the sugar the next time I make this. I loved the silky texture of the sauce. I also made the bhaja masala per your recipe. This one is a winner and I am now inspired to try other ""doi"" type recipes from you guys. Thanks as always for the precise measurements and your attention to detail."
Akqf_8-0jFQ,I only know one thing. Brinjal when cooked right brings flavors like nothing else. No other veggie can take that place.  But my dear brinji alone ❤😂

JrfPmWlKJ9o,"Being a fan of your channel for a long time, I can't help but relate so many Bengali dishes very similar to how my folks cook at home. My folks are from eastern Nepal (Dad's from Darjeeling) so there's a lot of similarities in our cooking. This is exactly how we cook fish at home.

8bVM45eccsY,Can we use dry cottage cheese which we get in supermarkets
8bVM45eccsY,Can I make tiny little balls of chhena and add it to the milk??
8bVM45eccsY,"I tried this recipe. Two things went wrong. 
The consistency of the milk. It was a little watery. 
Secondly i used 2 elaichi but i couldn't taste it in the final product. I feel we coarse grind elaichi and put into the milk it will release more flavours. ( I have not added rose water) 
What do you think?"
8bVM45eccsY,"I have tried this one
It was sooo tasty 😁"
8bVM45eccsY,"Hi, could you please provide the measurements in terms of teaspoons or tablespoons or cups? You provide the measurements in terms of grams which is very difficult to convert to measuring spoon or cup size. Thanks"

SVfZZoLg_No,I agree. He is hawtttt!
SVfZZoLg_No,"With all respect to the gentleman, I don't think I can agree.. The food rules in a community is not only a parameter to separate one tribe from the other, but often there's a geographical, historical, philosophical or even mythical explanation behind that rule, based on the time it was written down.."
SVfZZoLg_No,"i agree with everything he said until the food rules part . food rules develop from a LOT of other factors than just for developing an ""us versus them"" identity
it could be dependent on the foods that best grow in the climate , cattle that they domesticated over centuries, diseases that communities encountered (for e.g. during famines and periods of starvation populations in the desperate battle for survival starts to eat dogs , beetles , pigeons etc just to stay alive)
kimchi was developed as a desperate attempt to preserve food in salty sea water for consumption during winter months in Korea during famines"
SVfZZoLg_No,As a person of faith I have to say I completely disagree. But to each their own I guess...
SVfZZoLg_No,Quite insightful
SVfZZoLg_No,This is how learned men talk.. .. dearth of such species these days

G4Z72PxcugU,"Toasted sesame oil in puliyotharei. 
😁😁
We use that in Chinese stir fries here in Malaysia."
G4Z72PxcugU,I cant figure it out how you add chana dal and Urad dal to the rice ? I think those daal needs longer times to be cooked.  unless you added something precooked !  at 14:52.
G4Z72PxcugU,Fav channel with favorite person 🎉
G4Z72PxcugU,That comment might apply to Himalayan rice. Coastal rice was accompanied by spices ground with coconut on a stone and strained to make curry.

G4Z72PxcugU,Try the Japanese sesame oil for even more flavor
G4Z72PxcugU,are you guys talking too fast or it is edited?
G4Z72PxcugU,"I wouldn't fully agree with point that scientific thoughts were not applied in cooking. I think it was majorly applied in bengali cuisine. For example eating bitters like karela is good for gut health and is included in everyday diet during its availability, similarly singhi mach for people with low haemoglobin condition. In fact Dr BC Roys way of treating the patients were majorly by putting them on a curated diet that would help them with their conditions."
G4Z72PxcugU,Mr. Ashok should speak slow and clear
G4Z72PxcugU,She is boring

CiKA9Y_322M,"Am an ardent follower of all your recipes. Every dish I tried have always turned out to be perfect. But for this one, somehow I'm not able to get the dough-like consistency in the dal. Tried adding some maida so it holds better when put in hot oil. Any totka you would suggest for this?"
CiKA9Y_322M,"Beautiful❣️
Thanks for the lovely recipe. 
Love & blessings from Canada 🇨🇦"
CiKA9Y_322M,Jaggery is leaving lot of water while cooking. You should specify these things
CiKA9Y_322M,"Pulis breaking in oil😭😭😭
Please help. How to bind them. How to prevent breaking??????"
CiKA9Y_322M,Is it possible to provide all measuremnts in cup and teaspoon too? Thanks
CiKA9Y_322M,Pls post papdi chaat and nimki chaat recipes too @bongeats #bongeats
CiKA9Y_322M,How can you save the dough if it became too crumbly? I followed the recipe totally but I think I made the mistake of adding the whole 50g of rice flour instead of eye-balling.
CiKA9Y_322M,"I'm commenting on this channel 4 years later. Seems like I've found yet another similar dish between Bongs and Mallus! There's a tea-time snack in North Kerala called ""Unnakaya"" which looks exactly like this Pitha, in fact it has a coconut filling as well! The only difference is that the ""pastry"" is made from half-ripe Nendran bananas instead of Moong dal."
CiKA9Y_322M,Currently in Kolkata on a visit and I’m pleased to be able to try new-to-me items made with patali gur such as  rosh gullas made with gur (and accompanied by a gur syrup!!) and ice cream flavored and sweetened by gur. Delicious treats!

42tLyGESggw,Childhood memory
42tLyGESggw,Made it last evening.... I used rice flour n suji.... yummy 😋
42tLyGESggw,My mother used to make this on Poush Sankranti
42tLyGESggw,❤️❤️❤️ thank you
42tLyGESggw,"Amar thamma banay same jinis kintu 'dudh chosi' bole ar oi chosi gulo maida diye toiri kore, khub tasty hoy khete. Ebar thek chal er guri diye korte bolbo. BTW ami bong eats r video daily dekhi, onek kichhu sikhte pari, thank you."
jtP-iQpPNGw,"Finally made it for Poush Sankranti this year! It came out well, even though I panicked and put extra water in the rice flour dough at the first step. Thus, mine ended up too sticky for the simple two-motion process, but I got it to work with some extra rolling motions… very satisfying to get that nice shape. 
I used pilloncillo instead of nolen gur because that’s what’s local. It’s still a beautiful flavor, which felt more decadent than dark brown sugar. 
The pithe was so tender and nice to eat in the payesh. The quantity was enough for two big bowls, and though it took me a long time to finish making it, it was definitely worth it. Thanks bong eats for this spectacularly helpful video."

jtP-iQpPNGw,I had it at Kasturi...fell in love with it. Didn't know the name so check the bill and it said Choshier Payesh - made a mess of the pronunciation making it tough for my Bong friends to help me figure out how it was made. Managed to convey the name after a few attempts!
jtP-iQpPNGw,"Dear Saptarshi and Insiya, I am a big fan of your videos. Less talk and to the point recipe. Amazing audio and videography.
Try choshi with atta as well.
Tastes good.
Ankur"
jtP-iQpPNGw,"I tried. It was delicious. Thanks 👍.4*4#
 Imade a mistake of using gur in hot water and milk splitter. I also used less gur i.e. 100 gm only."

_zfLuo19g_E,Last e je orange toppings use korechen ota kothay paoa jai?
_zfLuo19g_E,Tried this cake two days back but the cake tasted bitter. It does taste good and orangey when you bite into it first  but leaves this really bitter aftertaste.
_zfLuo19g_E,Made this on Friday! Turned out so good that made another batch yesterday! Just had to share with more friends and family! Regret not discovering this earlier ie. at the peak of orange season. Truly the most orangey cake ever!!! Better than most of the faux vanilla cakes that they are selling in stores with a faux lemon/orange icing... Thank you for this recipe 🙏🙂
_zfLuo19g_E,Which brand oven? 4:58
_zfLuo19g_E,When do we add the posto? Couldn’t find it in the recipe.
_zfLuo19g_E,"I made this cake today. Very nice, soft and moist. Took almost 60 mins at 350F. Tastes yummy, very orangey and buttery."
_zfLuo19g_E,The best orange cake I ever had. The poppy seeds played their role very well in the texture. After the first one was a hit in my family I baked several in a row.

I was afraid that in the modern age when our grandmothers and for many their mothers are no more, and with the onslaught of so many influences around - these recipes will be lost forever, alongwith a large part of our identity. Taking it few steps beyond, you have applied precision to your recipes and used the most modern implements. Please take your efforts forwards and not leave any recipe uncovered. Wishing you two the very best. Also allow me to note that Insiya, in spite of coming from a widely differing background, is showing what an ideal Bengali lady can do with her culture. Live on!!"

D1T4i7mo928,"while i could drool over the non-veg dishes and seek them out during Kolkata trips, there was little hope it ever being cooked in a household which is mostly vegetarian. This is a recipe which showcase the ‘niramish’ cooking which was quite common even a few decades back. When an entire meal was cooked from ingredients sourced from the kitchen garden. There is little hope to savour these dishes in restaurants as they don’t translate well in such settings. Hope to see more such videos"

TTC6gZZOtMM,How about a video featuring those jazz musicians tirelessly playing away in the background in spite of not getting some recognition eh?
TTC6gZZOtMM,The link of the recipe doesn’t open. Thats the case with a lot of your recipes. The links do not open. Its always page not found. I had complained about it in another video of urs but seems like no solution has been found as yet.

_Z5UuEwkBQA,I'm watching this and now I decide not to cook .. need so much effort 😒 It'll be better to buy it from shop.😅
_Z5UuEwkBQA,Medu vada + chat masala + Amul dahi + khatta-mitha chatni + shredded fried curry leaves + jhuri vaja; I like it better than authentic soaking-wet ones.
_Z5UuEwkBQA,"Followed all your tips and tricks, and I must say that this turned out to be amazing! Thanks so much for your meticulous instructions that ensure the best final product every single time ❤"
_Z5UuEwkBQA,Made yesterday following this process......and it turned out very tasty..... everyone praised so much 🌈
_Z5UuEwkBQA,"One reason for flattening the vadas slightly, or poking that hole in the centre, as south indian versions do, is to have them cook all the way through. Making them slightly smaller also helps. I go with this last"
_Z5UuEwkBQA,Lovely presentation divai...u inspired me ❤️
_Z5UuEwkBQA,"Wow! I'm a Tamilian, and I love vadas! We call them vadai in Tamil, and "" Thayir Vadai"" in Tamil again. It's nice to see the Bengali version of our most loved vadai! Thank you for posting this recipe Ilisha & Saptarshi!"
_Z5UuEwkBQA,"always use ginger with skin peeled off in  case of tamilnadu style cooking. ginger skin has toxicity according to us,"
_Z5UuEwkBQA,Ur recipe   awesome   pleas tell us cake recipe  pitha   chicken  and vegetable recipes
_Z5UuEwkBQA,"Wowww! This recipe is a different and wonderful twist to the way dahi wadas are made in Maharashtra and Gujarat. 
Adding the Garam masala and the ginger to the buttermilk is sooo different & refreshing!"
_Z5UuEwkBQA,Hi! The Amazon link to this awesome mixing / whipping bowl in which you have whipped the udad dal batter is not working. Would you pleaseee check and give the link that works?
_Z5UuEwkBQA,Ama Cuttack Dahi Bara is Best in world ✌✌👍👍
_Z5UuEwkBQA,"I tried making it today.
My Maa and Abbu were so happy and proud 
They enjoyed every bite
All credits goes to @Bong Eats
I tried to do exactly same and it turned out like way beyond delicious.
Want to learn more and more recipes from you guys."
_Z5UuEwkBQA,Hey sarvana bhavan or southindians dont temper the curd . Its the khara boondi spicy one that has curry leaves . Vada is not soaked on buttermilk . Its served directly with curd on top . No red chilly powder or sweetness. Only toppings onion carrot boondi and coriander
_Z5UuEwkBQA,"Hi team,
Please make the video of Kolkata style dal vada which we get on streets of Kolkata . I have been requesting you since 3 years"
v1FAq9bla4A,"Everything is awesome, great ambiance, EXCEPT the cooking oil."
v1FAq9bla4A,Watched this video several times..one thing that stuck me today that in your final seasoning list salt is missing. Is it a glitch or the soya sauce is compensating the former. Please clarify. Thank you. Admirer
v1FAq9bla4A,Not sure how to make stock powder at home.
v1FAq9bla4A,Seriously this series needs to continue and some OTT needs to patron you guys .. awesome job 👍👍👍
v1FAq9bla4A,This looks amazingly scrumptious!! Thank you for posting! Amazing videography too! Now if someone can help me with my forever quest of getting the recipe for Trinca style Chinese Chopsuey (Chicken) - and I mean Chinese Chopsuey - the white one and NOT the red one ie American Chopsuey. Would be ever so grateful for a recipe. Have tried experimenting at home several times but have never been able to get it spot on. So any help would be appreciated. Many thanks!
v1FAq9bla4A,I wish uncle Rodger sees and reviews this Chinese cooking someday
v1FAq9bla4A,This is not just a food vlog or video it's a vibe💗
v1FAq9bla4A,Could you please make a video on how to make the stock powder ☺️
v1FAq9bla4A,A wonderful episode left Kolkatta in 1967  I live in Toronto Canada great to see Trincas still there thank you BONG EATS🙏
v1FAq9bla4A,HIGHLY recommend this. We made it three weekends in a row. So delicious. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
v1FAq9bla4A,But how to recreate this at home ? it's cooked on suchh a high flame which is not available at home
v1FAq9bla4A,Just want to clarify 1 point: The slurry uses corn starch or flour? Generally starch gives us a better result I guess.
v1FAq9bla4A,"Amazing cinematography and production. What a place, and what an ambience. And you captured it perfectly. Once again you've outdone yourselves. Love from the Maldives. ❤️"
v1FAq9bla4A,Brilliant camera work
v1FAq9bla4A,What is stock powder??
v1FAq9bla4A,In which step did the chicken stock get used in this recipe
v1FAq9bla4A,Wonderful series idea offering a rare behind-the-scenes look
IemEVaUNQMI,I think you should include Bagha in your videos. It would be so nice and inclusive. Much needed — as our pets are so integral part of our new family system now. I am sure a lot of people will learn from it.

rvVYt4U5O10,Simultaneous use of clarified butter (ghee) & coriander leaves in this receipe doesn’t make any sense.
rvVYt4U5O10,This is actually a wonderful recipe. Turned out really well. Added a bit of hing. Highly recommended this.
rvVYt4U5O10,So refreshing that measurements are given as spoonfuls and not 1/3/7 gms.😅

rvVYt4U5O10,I love how peeps in West Bengal just 'tumi' everyone.
rvVYt4U5O10,"The recipe was indeed really very nice nd the dal looks so tempting but a pinch Hing or asafoetida will increase the taste of the dal to another level😋😋😋
I always remember to add hing when I cook this toor  dal💖💖"
rvVYt4U5O10,"So I’m Goan and my mother in law is Bengali. She taught me to use a wooden spoon. Soak the dal, no pressure cooker and remove the scum. Game changer!"

1ycH8R5wylI,"For those looking for quality vanilla beans in India, Whatsapp Mr. Kedar Narayan Kolle at +91 99023 48997. This is vanilla grown in his own farm in Bhatkal, Karnataka. The price is about 2500 INR for 100 grams. You can give him our reference."
1ycH8R5wylI,My custard did not set properly even after keeping it in refrigerator overnight. I halved the recipe and baked it for the same amount of time. Could you tell me what might have gone wrong?
1ycH8R5wylI,Vanilla bean is not available here. What amount of vanilla essence shall i use ?
1ycH8R5wylI,Really would like to try this pudding. But I do have a request.  If I want to avoid  the egg yolks then how many whole eggs I can use for this pudding?  Your help would be highly appreciated.  Thanks I advance
1ycH8R5wylI,Please give the link to ur website
1ycH8R5wylI,eggless caramel pudding recipe dekhaben? R microwave oven a kivabe korbo?
1ycH8R5wylI,I don't like the smell of vanilla or vanilla extract. Can we skip that part? Or get anything easy as a substitute?? Please reply me
1ycH8R5wylI,"Made this today, and it was an absolute hit amongst all the guests and family alike.. thank you so much!!"
1ycH8R5wylI,"Just made the pudding on gas stove following your recipe and it was mind blowing. I added custard powder (dissolved in milk) also. 
Looking forward to your recipe in the website.😊"
1ycH8R5wylI,"Also a note, if you don't have cream on your house, use condensed milk. Because in the other flan recipes I've seen condensed milk."
1ycH8R5wylI,"OMG, this recipe is very diferent from the mexican. We also cook and eat flan w sugar or cajeta syrup, but we put all on the mixer and after we bake, that's all 😅 btw I will try this way"
1ycH8R5wylI,Ki cream use korte hobe? Normal amul cream?
1ycH8R5wylI,Wow! reminds me of my mom making this delicacy ❤ btw where did you guys get this lovely white n blue piece of art from (the serving bowl)?
1ycH8R5wylI,I absolutely loved the recipe and have been looking at the ceramic bowl with beady eyes. Could you please share the link from where you bought the pretty blue and white dessert bowl.
1ycH8R5wylI,Ki cream use korte hobe? Heavy cream?
1ycH8R5wylI,"The caramel trick really works. I mean adding a little water will stop your caramel from burning.. when I first made my pudding I was making the caramel and constantly burnt it.. then I had a friend who is a succesful cooking youtuber.. I asked her for help, she told me to add a little water when the caramel is perfectly dark.. I did the same and voila, perfect caramel for pudding"
1ycH8R5wylI,Turned out great. Thanks!

Because I always did that part for my mom back home and she used to be so proud of how meticulously I did that. Now a thousand miles away from home, I miss this dish like hell."

Bjq2EYOrXlc,"Please make kochupata chingri, would love to see that recipe"
Bjq2EYOrXlc,"In Chittagong Bangladesh,they do the same with Salty Hilsha Fish (a special type available in Chittagong local markets,the hilsha kept under salt like dry fish or shutki but not dried, nona ilish).
they call it ""kodhu pata di nunaiya ilish paturi"",,, just same style,,all other ingredients are same but they use more chilli. 
how can a west bengal recipe can be so similar to that of the most eastern zone who are not related at all.
but It's observable that kolkata has more similarities in food with arakans than their nearer bangladeshi districts.Many a chatgaiya tell so."
Bjq2EYOrXlc,The amount of chingri used for steaming is not mentioned. It seems like the 750 gms of chingri was divided into 3 portions for three different techniques of cooking. So may be it is 250 gms. Yet since you guys are so precise it would be great of you mention that as well.
Bjq2EYOrXlc,Dada why are you speaking so much English your Chanel is about Bengali dishes and you are a Bengali so why are you feel so hesitate in speaking bengali
Bjq2EYOrXlc,why am I hungry right now! 🥲
Bjq2EYOrXlc,Great !
Bjq2EYOrXlc,Wow .  Darooon hobe  .. I'm going to try it out some day..

KEFoA6p1FjY,"All your recipes are best . But I have a request to you that Please make all your recipes visual and audio both , otherwise many who are not a good cook can not follow fully your recipe . Please think about it. Thanks for share very good recipes to us."
KEFoA6p1FjY,"This must be the quintessentially Bengali comfort food. 😊
To be honest, Bengalis love mutton kosha and bhetki fish fry, they die for ilish and bagda prawn - but at the centre of all is our very homely রুই মাছের ঝোল - un-glamorous, low in the spice scale, and yet, accompanied by a bowl of plain white rice, infinitely pleasurable for the soul. 😌"
KEFoA6p1FjY,"@bongeats Now that you have collab'ed with Krish Ashok, why not put out an algorithm for bangali maacher jhol/jhal, from the kalo jeere and water version up to the more complex ones?"
KEFoA6p1FjY,I was seriously ill today and this machher jhol saved my day. I have followed each and every little detail of this recipe and the result was exactly like the one which I used to have at home. Only I have added a bit of grated turmeric root instead of turmeric powder in order to make it healthier.
KEFoA6p1FjY,We add a Tomato in this Macher Jhol. 🙏🏻🙏🏻

Marinate just as you will do with রুই মাছ। After that cook the way you'd cook রুই মাছ। Don't forget to fry before you cook. And, if you don't want to go to hell after this life, don't forget to add large chunks of আলু, shaped as wedges and marinated and fried just as you would do with রুই মাছ"

rwaA5HEdcw4,One of my fav dish in summer rainy  season
rwaA5HEdcw4,The Lemon part was the best in the vdo😳❤️
rwaA5HEdcw4,An easier way to get rid of the slime is by rubbing crushed papaya leaves (pepe pata bata) on the fish and washing it off after a moment. The enzymes and juice from the papaya leaves breaks down the slime.
rwaA5HEdcw4,Maach tar thekeo jhol ta khete bhalo lage 😍

6F5PaAvBbOg,"What is your family's favourite stuffing for dorma? 
🧄🧄🧄
CORRECTION!
Unless you are chasing vampires do not use 100g garlic, as mentioned in the video. Please use only 10g. It was a typo. 😩"
6F5PaAvBbOg,Thanks
6F5PaAvBbOg,Sob e perfect chilo apart from adding unnecessary those potatoes
6F5PaAvBbOg,So Messy
6F5PaAvBbOg,"Today, first time I've made it. Sorry but as stuffing chholar dal is not so good idea in potol er dorma. The taste came out very bad for me 😭"
6F5PaAvBbOg,"As you have mixed the veg and fish dorma, its very confusing. Suddenly in between cooking while watching, the ingredients change 😢"
6F5PaAvBbOg,This isn't authentic potol dorma  recipe ❌
6F5PaAvBbOg,We use qeema for filling
6F5PaAvBbOg,"Hi, I follow you channel very often. I have a very basic question. I often see that you recommend to fry the vegetables separately before going into a gravy to hold its shape. To choose health over authenticity, will there be a huge difference in taste if I boil it instead of  frying. Example in this recipe you fried the Potol at first and again it was in the gravy at the end where it would soak in the flavours. Would it make a lot of difference if I boiled the Potol with salt and water and then  put the filling ? What are your thoughts?"
FBnKYbUNhYc,Your utensils are too good.
FBnKYbUNhYc,Great recipe. The videography is top notch. Simply amazing work 👍👍
FBnKYbUNhYc,"Hello I follow your recipes. But today here I am to ask about one of the kitchen tools you use, i.e, the khunti. I searched the link you provided for kitchen tools, but there the khunti is not like the one you use. I want that…😊 can you plz tell me where I can get that?"

FBnKYbUNhYc,Add haldi to water before dropping  cut echor pieces in vessel.
FBnKYbUNhYc,Why people put tomatoes on every dish? It's not Mandatory to put tomatoes
FBnKYbUNhYc,"Loved the rewind for echor -chingri😍
Aj baba k bllm apnader channel dekhi.. baire thekeo bangalir khawar banan. Baba r ami aj echor banachi😊"
FBnKYbUNhYc,No onions added in this recipe? What if we add onions?
FBnKYbUNhYc,"Just when I was thinking to go find echor chingri recipe, did y’all ask whether I was looking for it! Hahah awesome editing, and perfectly bong!"
FBnKYbUNhYc,I think tokdaal and enchorer torkari is a core memory for most bengalis. It's a winning combination

TRANSLATION: The neem jhol shown in this recipe is a very light version that is made in our family when the weather is very hot. It is easy on the stomach and satisfying. This recipe only uses neem leaves, drumsticks, potatoes and sweet potatoes, and almost no ground spices apart from turmeric. However, there are more elaborate versions of neem jhol that use more ground spices, ginger, etc. and a tempering of either panch phoron or methi + mustard. Additionally, neem jhol can include a lot of other summer vegetables such as pointed gourd (potol), green bananas, green papaya, brinjal, and if you are making this in the beginning of Spring, sheem (broad beans). We will make that version some other time."
oMA8gjEfu5g,I feel there is no need to remove fibers from drumstick 😊😊😊
oMA8gjEfu5g,One of my favorite item neem 😋 yummy
oMA8gjEfu5g,My mother-in-law makes this!
oMA8gjEfu5g,"This dish is what makes traditional ""bangali ranna"" so special...one single meal, especially the afternoon meal, tries to incorporate all possible flavours and tastes at one ago...that's why a dish of bitter vegetables is a must there...makes the whole meal so balanced and healthy."
oMA8gjEfu5g,Hi Bong eats! Please upload a guide to peeling drumsticks. I need to know it..
oMA8gjEfu5g,"I knew neem begun bhaja, it is a new receipe for me, could I add brinjal to this curry?"
oMA8gjEfu5g,We also add kulekhara and begun to it. Because I don't like neem pata 😝
oMA8gjEfu5g,What dal bori did u use for the recipe ?
oMA8gjEfu5g,Completely unrelated question but I was wondering if you could recommend any kitchen weighing scale. the one's coming on the first few pages of Amazon are completely garbage after some thorough researchiy I even ordered a scale from a Japanese brand but was scammed as the buttons didn't click I checked your website the link redirects to an out of stock product. Which scales you guys personally use?

7qNeHXlP9Mw,"Wonderful!  You are doing so much to unite us Bongs and keep Bengali cuisine and culture alive and well. Bravo!
I would suggest to American expats or natives, that you can use a Mexican Molcajete (say Mol-ka-hay-tay) to grind posto (white poppy seed) which is just like a shil-nora.  By the way, eating poppy seeds in this dish, or in cakes, bagels, etc, will give you a positive reading on a drug test.  It takes 15 days to leave your system. Just mention it on the paperwork.

Loved the format!  Also loved reading the Bangla and English emails.  Such fabulous recipes, oh my! Brings back my youth in Calcutta.  Please do a series on classic Bengali mango pickles.  I don't want to lose those precious Aam pickle recipes.  There was also this dried, salted ginger mouth freshener pickle like Amloki salted.  Thank you so much for these gems!! Subscribed."

36Ax1_XH-B4,Wow so much research! You guys are pros!
36Ax1_XH-B4,"1 small addition to this info set would be great is the software that you use for editing, I have jusy started our channel, https://youtube.com/@westylelife , very new though, but would really appreciate your tips on editing.
Anyways your videos are in literal sense a Treat to the eyes.
Thanks a lot for bringing these wonderful content to us, staying away from Kolkata really seems unreal for the duration of your video."
36Ax1_XH-B4,You can be a tech reviewer bro. Good detailed review. I hope you can also mention our Cooking Channel :)
36Ax1_XH-B4,What is the editing software you are using ?
36Ax1_XH-B4,Being a sound engineer I am curious to know what microphone and recorder you use. I absolutely love the sound (recording and design) of your videos.
36Ax1_XH-B4,"Without light, there is no image
Engineer talking"
36Ax1_XH-B4,"very useful information, thank you."
36Ax1_XH-B4,You speak so well 💎
36Ax1_XH-B4,"Apart from great cooking and equally great filming, what I have always appreciated is correct English...which is almost unicorn these days....whatever text you put on the screen is correctly spelled and grammatically correct. Which is a very rare thing these days. That was kind of the first hook for me for this channel. Proper education goes a long way. 😀"
36Ax1_XH-B4,What are the lights you have used can you please share the link.
36Ax1_XH-B4,"Your desktop configuration ?

RsOMEcQ0GxY,In Bihar we add gram flour instead of maida little pepper and garlic paste. Try it.
RsOMEcQ0GxY,Masterclass at presentation! ❤️
RsOMEcQ0GxY,This fish looks like bullet train 🙄
RsOMEcQ0GxY,Some shichuan pepper corn with sesame oil on chili oil plz
RsOMEcQ0GxY,"This is a very good recipe. I will attempt to make this more Bengali. I have noticed that you have used mung bean noodles, I would try to use rice noodles or mixture of the two. I would also add something crunchy to the dish. The Kolmi shaak didn't need to be fried, you could have blanched it in the broth, it is now too wilted. I would also add chingri shutki to add an extra layer of flavour. I would refrain from using butter, it is blunts all other sharp flavours that went into the soup. I would refrain from using wine, it is way too foreign. But hats off to you for planting the seed of an idea."
RsOMEcQ0GxY,Can we skip using wine? Any easy available substitute for the same please suggest
RsOMEcQ0GxY,Looks so simple but wow! All the work behind it makes this an absolute joy to watch. Thanks for sharing this.
RsOMEcQ0GxY,For a moment I thought it was Ramen.
RsOMEcQ0GxY,"How does one get chitol keema? The only time I ate chitol it was so full of small bones it became an instant irritant.

If anyone wanted fishballs bhetki is a much better and yummier option."

RsOMEcQ0GxY,It was a long video for bong eats.as a vegetarian watched very patiently for the divine strains of music and the process.learnt a lot.plating.was well explained.thanks
RsOMEcQ0GxY,I think this is really good.
7qVyaZP7QQ8,Can I make paturi after frying the fish
7qVyaZP7QQ8,"As someone whos never made this before, would it be possible to make the fish + banana leaf parcel ahead of time for a party and then cook it later once guests start arriving or will that mess with the texture of the fish?"

Gauv7ArVg5U,Where can I find good pork ribs in Kolkata...
Gauv7ArVg5U,Hmm you can seldom find faults in any of the videos but I must say that the cut of meat is probably wrong. Ribs &/or short ribs and chops are different cuts that comes from different part of the animal.
Gauv7ArVg5U,Why don't you give ingredient quantities in teaspoons and tablespoons especially for tiny amounts of ingredients like salt etc?
Gauv7ArVg5U,"Hello, I am a huge fan of your videos and love your recipes. I'd love to try this recipe, but I was wondering if mutton or beef can be substituted here, keeping rest of the ingredients the same. I would love to try it this weekend for my family. looking forward to your reply."
Gauv7ArVg5U,Thank you for sharing this recipe..I tried it (minus the green chillies) last night and the result was amazing 🥰  I want to try it with pork shoulder now ( ribs don't have enough meat 😛). Please keep the good stuff coming 🙂 xx

Every cooking depends on one's tongue. I blanch the vegetables and fry the fish, then in butter I add the vegetables salt juice of the masala. A bit later I add cornflour mived milk and the fish. Mine is a bengali stew good for days of stomach problem. You can try"
w8Y6ciDKdVo,I used to make chicken stew before but it always lacked something.. the taste was never good. This time I followed your recipe and the stew was perfect.. thank you for making this video.

34I_PRyaVGo,"When it comes to gourmet food, our dear old Kolkata is the Best."
34I_PRyaVGo,Mutton my favorite........ ami nschoi try krbo
34I_PRyaVGo,eating Maggie while watching this :')
34I_PRyaVGo,"No, I'm sorry to say, this is not a traditional Nizam's Kati Kabab the way I remember from before 1978.  Maybe they have changed. This may be a Kolkata Mutton Roll, but its not a Calcutta Nizam's Kati Kabab from my era.
This is how they made it then:
Porota similar to yours but not deep fried. It was healthier less oily.
They would whisk egg and drop a little egg into a hot pan or kara, swish a cooked porota over it, so egg made an omelette on one side of the porotha.
Slide a succulent tandoor chicken kabab into the porota.
Garnish with fresh red onion sliced, a sprig of dhone patha (cilantro), and squeeze a lemon / lime over the onions.
Roll up in waxed paper and serve open ended.

The onions were not marinated in lemon juice, that would wilt them.
The mutton was similarly made, and your recipe is too exotic and not correct for their fresh food type of kabab.
The emphasis was on simplicity, but you have elaborated too much.  This is not Nizam style as far as I know.

Maybe Nizams' has changed through the years I have been an expat, who knows.
Your spice mixtures are however, extraordinary and fragrant.  I will try that.
Good demo, many thanks!  You have put a lot of work on this recipe and it is very much appreciated"
34I_PRyaVGo,"No other YouTube er has done justice to this recipe, including the celebrity chef's. BEeats is par excellence, they rightly bring Bengali cuisine to the world."
34I_PRyaVGo,"Kolkata-style is beef, not so much mutton and certainly NOT insipid chicken!!!"
34I_PRyaVGo,Tell honestly... How was the feeling after first bite?
34I_PRyaVGo,Love the recipe. Will definitely try it.
34I_PRyaVGo,"Gas+electricity+soap for utensil+water+time all spent
And the recipe became tasty 😋"
34I_PRyaVGo,"U r just amazing, thanks for this wonderful recipe"

yR2RcEGjreA,"We served 'Radhaballabhi' while my sister got married and it was a memory (only) since then, when, I used to be a child.

I wasn't a foodie but luckily, habituated afterwards, then sadly, the habit ruined and I got sick badly.

Now-a-days, I can't take food anymore and thus, I lost every health, although before this, I lost my mind too.

May god bless us."

hOv7Rk7bHtI,ashombhob sundor presentation ...
hOv7Rk7bHtI,Tried the recipe. The meat turned out to be very soft. It was melting inside the mouth. My concern is that it turned out bitter. Is it because of the papaya skin? Any suggestions?

hOv7Rk7bHtI,That ripping apart of cooked meat at the end is what I was looking for. No struggle whatsoever. Proved to me that it was tender owing to the additives - papaya paste and vinegar. Good job. On the menu for Friday's dinner.
hOv7Rk7bHtI,"Last weekend there was a Bbq party and i made this from my contribution, the whole bunch of people were blown away by the taste and flavours.

bIp0Sa5clsA,"I made this on my birthday &everyone loved it. I have learned a lot from your channel. 
Thank u for your beautiful videos"
bIp0Sa5clsA,Hey! I am a Bengali millennial who has the habit to buy fresh eye catching vegetables with no idea of cooking it. But trust me you guys are a saviour. I bought and ignored a papaya for more than a week then realised let's cook it. Sadly Pepe bhaja is the only thing I like with Pepe. And trust me this recipe made my day. I fed it to my non bong fiance and he just fell for me all over again😅❤️
bIp0Sa5clsA,I made it today..... Honestly you bought my long gone grandmom back through taste..... No words to thank❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
bIp0Sa5clsA,Can it be eaten without rice ?
bIp0Sa5clsA,Thank you for keeping these recepies alive
bIp0Sa5clsA,"If u add khaar to the same procedure it instead of dudh moida  becomes ""omita khaar"" 🤭🤭🤣🤣"
bIp0Sa5clsA,Thankuni pata... Our wealth... Health friendly...
bIp0Sa5clsA,Can we replace korola pata or thankuni pata with bitter gourd? Those leaves are hard to find in the USA.
bIp0Sa5clsA,"I tried out it today ..only the korola leaves I didn’t had so putted some karola instead of leaves ,just osadharon hoyeche..even my 6yrs kid also liked it she’s not fond of papaya bt she told valo Mamma eta..thanks for this thakumar recipe .I hv searched it from long couldn’t find it..plz share some more recipes like this.Much love for Bong Cook."
bIp0Sa5clsA,"Loved the recipe. Just want to know if insted of milk & maida, can I add coconut milk?"
bIp0Sa5clsA,"Beautiful, must try. ❤️"
0glpRWtn8gE,Thank you for sharing this simple comfort food in such a beautiful way. I am just wondering whether the milk wouldn't curdle because of the lebu?

0glpRWtn8gE,My mouth is literally watering watching this. I super loved this thing specially when my Dida made it for me. So many nice memories. This is nostalgia ♥️
0glpRWtn8gE,Milk with lemon 🤔 is it not harmful for health?
0glpRWtn8gE,Thanks a ton !!! For this easy non cooked recipe...spent half of my life in cornflakes and oats and branflakes...this easy alternative in game changer ☺️☺️.. hopefully me and my daughter can digest well...one request if possible make such recipe on 'khoi' also.. plsssssssss
0glpRWtn8gE,Three fruits are banned for me and sugar....alas

0glpRWtn8gE,My heart just cried out to just have a spoonful of it as I miss it so much in foreign land.
AD8R1JBmIa0,"When I started cooking food, I knew nothing.. Thanks to your channel.. I learnt  a lot.."
AD8R1JBmIa0,I always eagerly wait for 2nd part of the theme. I get a joy as if the food is ready to eat when the 2nd theme pops 3:41
AD8R1JBmIa0,please show recipe for mourola macher chorchori
AD8R1JBmIa0,Please give recipe with tamarind

AD8R1JBmIa0,How come sugar is added
AD8R1JBmIa0,Loved the recipe.. Especially good to know the cleaning part..
AD8R1JBmIa0,I am a vegetarian feeling very pity about those cute fishes😔
ABL3qguRomA,"Ami ei recipe ta try korechi 
Just wow 👌"
ABL3qguRomA,Lastly in recipes the ingredients used make a huge difference we must know what to use other than using to follow recipes trying to make them best or perfect with all instructions. In absence of proper sense any good recipe is not possible using mind as preferred mostly getting it done is most need.
ABL3qguRomA,Khorcha r Khorcha
ABL3qguRomA,Love it..
ABL3qguRomA,Thanks ❤️👍🏻🙏
ABL3qguRomA,Why have you stopped uploading cooking videos in your channel nowadays?
ABL3qguRomA,What is 'charoli'  in Bengali?
ABL3qguRomA,U dint put sugar in it...
ABL3qguRomA,Please can you let me know from where you bought the blue & white Chinese bowl? I have been looking to buy this for so long. Love your channel and your perfect methods!
ABL3qguRomA,Yummy recipe.... And the presentation is awesome
ABL3qguRomA,These videos make me miss home so much
9plsiNv6qv8,Please give the calorie count of each paratha as you do in other recipes 😊
9plsiNv6qv8,😊how long can this be stored outside the fridge. Please let me know?
9plsiNv6qv8,Awesome & Thanks :)
9plsiNv6qv8,"We biharis love your videos as much as bong, you really make amazing food.
Although in this I will prefer bihari version of sattu paratha but i can be biased as i am bihari."
9plsiNv6qv8,"U use water in sattu Paratha?????
Where is mustard oil?????
Wrong dish"
9plsiNv6qv8,Omg the bestest recipe so yummy & healthy thank you bong eats❤
9plsiNv6qv8,"Sis this is a Bihari dish and no sugar is added at any stage. In the Chhatu mixture lemon juice, garlic and mustard oil is also added."
9plsiNv6qv8,"God, this is making me so hungry!!"
9plsiNv6qv8,i tried this recipie it’s too yummy
9plsiNv6qv8,I have no sattu we used chana dal make soft and grind
9plsiNv6qv8,"I never heard of this porota before, but I made it today for a friend who’s temporarily homeless (😢), since it keeps well and sustains farmers, travelers, and students alike! I didn’t even have chattu, but I carefully toasted besan. My friend won’t have achar, and the finely-milled besan is a bit dense  😬… so I made the chattu mixture very flavorful, following the advice from all the lovely Biharis in the comments! Mustard oil, kalo jeera, black pepper, garlic, and lemon juice. Also, I added amchur and lanka guro to reinforce the tauk/sour and jhal/spicy, and I used half coriander leaves & half curry leaves for the herbs. I hope the spices will keep my friend healthy through this tough period. I think it tastes fantastic, will make it again for myself to eat with plain yogurt or dal."
9plsiNv6qv8,the recipe is good...and the sounds are so satisfying ❤️
9plsiNv6qv8,"From a bong born in Bihar, love it. As suggested mustard oil, lemon juice and a green chillies make sattu super yum. Keep it coming :)"
9plsiNv6qv8,Love sattu ka paratha 😊 Thank you for the recipe. Needed some mustard oil and some lime juice for that perfect Bihari touch.
tT_N5n5mLrs,Bro....dek ki he maza agaya....right now my mouth is filled with saliva.
tT_N5n5mLrs,Sorry to say but This is not the one.
tT_N5n5mLrs,"Hello admin 💤, please share the ingredient list 🙏, the link you mentioned is not working."
tT_N5n5mLrs,"A very authentic and elaborate recipe, and much appreciated.  I can smell the spices from California!  This is one of your finest to date. The visuals were very good and clear.  The first time I tasted Haleem was in a Pakistani cafe in Redondo Beach, Los Angeles area, California.  An old school Muslim guy who owned this cafe was giving out bowls of Haleem to customers urging them to try it.  I did.  I felt it warming up my whole body it was incredible, just like a hot water bottle INSIDE my tummy. The heat rose from the food, the energy dense wheat, barley, meat, and spices.  Sure keeps you warm in winter!

I had not heard of cubeb or tailed pepper/Java pepper before.  It appears that China used to buy this pepper from India in the 1700s, and Indians called it kabab (cubeb) chini (Chinese) due to to it's preference by the Chinese.  It's lovely to know all the Bengali words for spices.  You should do a video on that.  I also appreciate your lovely video on Shahi Gorom Moshla, wow!  Such a great one.  I have American friends who are all making it now!

PS - My comment would not be complete without my implacable resistance to your forced music.  It is such a pity that you need to add loud music (or any music) to this sensory overload of visuals, sound, instructions, measurements, flavorings, and analysis we are trying to do on a recipe.  A recipe is alchemy and we are chemists. Would you force music on chemistry students in a lab?  This is as much out of place as that would be.  Improve your channel by not adding music and you will move far ahead of the competition.  No one appreciates having music thrust upon them, repetitive and mind-numbing."
tT_N5n5mLrs,Go to Hyderabad & try to learn the recipe first properly
tT_N5n5mLrs,Not properly cooked
tT_N5n5mLrs,"A wonderful rendition that cannot be improved any further much as we may try. Thanks a lot to two of you. I was from Park Circus, Kolkata and I know the appeal of haleem that Kolkatans are often subjected to during this tie of the year."
tT_N5n5mLrs,"Honestly for me the essence of haleem is lost if I find huge mutton chunks. Meat has to blend in the gravy mix and for that only minced meat can be used.
Behrouz or hyd version any day better.
Kol version feels like other meat curry recipes."
tT_N5n5mLrs,Cooking them all together wouldn't be much different now would it?
tT_N5n5mLrs,oh my god thank you so much!!!
tT_N5n5mLrs,I tried. It was delicious. Thanks for the recipe. 👍 Ingredients list may be added at the start. It helps.
tT_N5n5mLrs,"I had to watch the entire recipe just because it was so enjoyable! Such a well-made video. Definitely, use this recipe to make haleem."
tT_N5n5mLrs,"Randomly mutton haleem khujlam, bong eats already post kore rekheche."
tT_N5n5mLrs,I wish you were my relative☹☹
tT_N5n5mLrs,how  much mutton was used?
tT_N5n5mLrs,Uff what a perfection 😃
yq3TzV5oYwc,I like your recipe very much
yq3TzV5oYwc,Will this taste good if i retain the kachkola skins?
yq3TzV5oYwc,Kachkola is not  my favorite  vegetable but this recipe is darun and I may try it.
yq3TzV5oYwc,"Can we use onion, since it’s a dalna? I have had this in my childhood, but don't remember if onion was used."
yq3TzV5oYwc,Please post more such veg recipes!! Please please 🙏🏻
yq3TzV5oYwc,Can I use biulir dal instead of masoor dal to make the bora?
yq3TzV5oYwc,12 GRAMS of salt? Plus all the other bits of salt. Are you trying to kills us 😂
yq3TzV5oYwc,"Mosur daal r theke motor daal r bora dile, ranna tar taste onyo level pabe"
yq3TzV5oYwc,"I like your every resipe, I enjoy making it,thank you"
yq3TzV5oYwc,In bengali there is a saying adae kachkola. How can we give ginger with kachkola?
yq3TzV5oYwc,Without music aur bhi achcha lagega video
yq3TzV5oYwc,Link to recipe seems broken?
yq3TzV5oYwc,Ur dishes and this background music..ufff.. both makes me like Go hungry.. jibhe jal eshe jaaye 😀❤️

rmtXRsRV_8U,Offf aar para jachhe na 😂😂😂
rmtXRsRV_8U,"Im pregnant and all these snacks like alu kabli, murimakha phuchka are such cravings right now! But since I cant make them, im watching them in your channel😢😢😢😂😂❤❤❤"
rmtXRsRV_8U,It's best serve in kola pata pouch..
rmtXRsRV_8U,"I follow most of your videos. But here I am afraid to say that the veg chopping has not been as per tradition. Though I must add that the art of Alu Kabli is dying, and while we 45+ guys can remember it well, recreating it by the younger crowd will be a challenge. 

Additional Note: there are 2 distinct types, Bengali & Bihari. Just like jhaal muri/ moshla muri has 2 distinct types which again branch out as per parts of Kolkata or Bengal. Or, ghughni. Or, phuchka.

Kindly don't take my observations negatively, I'm extremely passionate about the Calcuttan street food scene, and I lament the slow demise or change in taste of the traditional preparations/ tastes of the above stuff, as also things like the Telebhajas, local parar dokaner rolls, the chhakni- chhnaka dudhchaa at the local shops, etc."
rmtXRsRV_8U,"It is ridiculous how authentic your recipes taste!😍 I’ve made them time and over and it never fails to amaze people!
If you could make a recipe for the phuchka wala’s aloo’r dum, I’d legit be forever indebted!😀"
rmtXRsRV_8U,"No meaningless chit-chat, 
No wasted time,
No face, 
No voice
PAIR of 🙏 HANDS 
DOING NICE JOB
That’s all 
I subscribed ✅"
rmtXRsRV_8U,"Everything is wrong here 
Starting from the cutting of aloo to the cutting of other stuffs"
rmtXRsRV_8U,Ah an emotion❣️...
rmtXRsRV_8U,I didn’t like the Biriyani. I suggest one should add oil in pressure cooker and cook the marinated mutton for atleast 15 mins without adding water. Then follow the other steps e.g add water and pressure cook.
rmtXRsRV_8U,School ar kotha mona pora galo.jast 👏

9EPeCZkvhhA,Obsessed with this channel ✨
9EPeCZkvhhA,"Tips: use coconut burada for the right texture. Use yellow chilli powder for the correct heat. Rub with slit green chillis before marinating. Also in old Delhi the whole leg and thigh as well as big breast pieces are used. If you don't want to use water use chicken stock. But it helps with the flavours.

Great video and yummy recipe."

Initially I was worried about eating a medium steak, but I've gotta admit that the taste was absolutely mindblowing. I strongly believe that food has no religion and a real foodie should try out food from all regions and countries. Can't wait to try out the beef roast this Christmas."

NfDXmzS7CsI,You videos are absolutely brilliant. They are a treat to the eyes as well. Kudos!
NfDXmzS7CsI,Bloody too consuming and difficult to make. I will buy instead
NfDXmzS7CsI,Any induction cooktop owners who have figured out how to light that piece of charcoal? I currently use liquid smoke but would so love to use the real thing😢
NfDXmzS7CsI,When kneading instead of dalda can we use ghee or oil?
NfDXmzS7CsI,Better asmr than most other dedicated asmr channels.
NfDXmzS7CsI,I'm from Patna and i love Kolkata chicken/mutton roll and Kolkata style biryani but unfortunately you won't find authentic Kolkata food in Patna
NfDXmzS7CsI,Bong eats jokhon nam rekheco tokhon title gulo bangla tei dao.....nahooe channel er nam paltao
NfDXmzS7CsI,"Hello
I want to know for how many minutes should the oven pre heat?"
NfDXmzS7CsI,Which oven is it ?
NfDXmzS7CsI,Instant slobberification.
NfDXmzS7CsI,"For those in US, I suggest using tenderizer instead of salt, helps chicken gets really soft. Also, bake for say 10 minutes or so , this helps  you control how much time you spend frying your chicken with onion and still have very soft and juicy chicken kabobs for your rolls."
NfDXmzS7CsI,Seeing this just can't wait to come to Calcutta....missing your roll your biryani
sOKFdGDbzCI,Can we put chicken keema insted of mutton?
sOKFdGDbzCI,"Fantastic recipe, just like my late mother use to make. Thank you. 🙏🙏🇬🇧🇮🇳"
sOKFdGDbzCI,You are a fantastic  cook❤
sOKFdGDbzCI,Can i prepare this recipe with chicken keema as i dont eat mutton?
sOKFdGDbzCI,Can this be done with chicken keema?
sOKFdGDbzCI,"Hey @bongeats, we loved this recipe. 

But we got a little confused about the 6 eggs, if they were all for the deviled eggs or a part of them were needed for the crumb mixture.

Your videos have so much clarity, I thought putting it here would help you ✌️

Thank you so much, your channel is amazing"
sOKFdGDbzCI,How many pieces of egg devil can be made using 1kg chicken as keema???
sOKFdGDbzCI,Instead of mutton can chicken be used??
sOKFdGDbzCI,"I can smell these in California, mmmmm!!!!  Heavenly!  Very nice masala mixture, so fragrant.
I would not mix meat with water, however. This is a bad idea.  Meat juices and blood must caramelize in a hot pan with sizzling spices.  You are braising the meat. When you make this slurry, you boil the meat and the blood. The taste is gone. This must not happen.  Meat must always be seared, braised, fried, grilled, broiled, etc. The idea is to cook the juices and brown them. When you boil meat, you get tasteless scum that looks grey, not caramelized browned taste.  Same way you treat onions when browned vs boiled.

You could also use cornstarch instead of flour for final coating.  This is a lovely variation on Scotch Eggs, and so great for picnics and travel!"
sOKFdGDbzCI,"I tried this recipe today, turned out to be pretty good. Thank you Bongeats"
sOKFdGDbzCI,If you add that breadcrumb (rusk crumb) it will give sand like texture to the meat so better be using fresh bread to avoid the sand texture
sOKFdGDbzCI,This is scotch eggs
sOKFdGDbzCI,"Apnader recipe gulo besh bhalo, detailed, ebong besh authentic taste aase dishgulo te.

qf0DMFI6kLk,Want a bangla version of phuchka making. 😢😢
qf0DMFI6kLk,This girl eats so disgustingly
qf0DMFI6kLk,honestly  I didn't like bengali phuchka 😵🥴😵 Something is missing in that. As being a Delhite I am habitual having Punjabi/North Indian style Golgappa which is spicy and sometimes Mango and Guava spicy water is added with Saunth(Dry Ginger) Chutney and Green Spicy Chutney 😋😋😋😋. Delhi te golgappe da jawab te koi competition nai hai.  Je tusi ik bar khandeo te muh te taste nai utarda.
qf0DMFI6kLk,"That's too much of knowledge 😂😂 weight wise, time wise process. Nice analysis. I can choose it as my PhD topic 😂"
qf0DMFI6kLk,Wonder Munna is hilarious🤣 love it.. already started watching wonder-munna videos😍👏🥰..amazing collaboration👏Phuchka skit at the end stole the show...watched it more than once now❤ Thanks for taking the effort for introducing us non-bengalis to authentic bengali food😋
qf0DMFI6kLk,So we don't need to boil Or pressure-cook kala-chana(bengal gram/chhola) after soaking? Do they get soft enough only by soaking and not boiling? That's the only thing i am confused about. For how much time do we need to soak kala-chana(chhola)? Overnight?
qf0DMFI6kLk,Sotti darun but who has this much time to make a single snack? Thats the reality
qf0DMFI6kLk,Chat Masala recipe please!!
qf0DMFI6kLk,This is not fucka this is golgappa
QG5qrZwl520,"For 2nd recipe, which aata is used? Is it maida or wheat flour?"
QG5qrZwl520,To be honest i dont understand why u go with so much details .. who cooks with scale to measure .. y to complicate.. and even simple foods u make them complicated.. hav a thought if u care
QG5qrZwl520,Which flour? Wheat flour?
QG5qrZwl520,Kumro r buko bora please upload korun. I miss my mom's cooking and without physical guidance it's impossible to get things right 🤪. So I depend on YouTube videos to cook well 😎 somehow my kumro buko boras aren't as tasty as my mom's 😭 wondering where I'm going wrong 🙏
QG5qrZwl520,Each of your recipes makes one truly hungry.... Too good
QG5qrZwl520,Very nice and use full cutting process..
QG5qrZwl520,Awesome recipe Mam. Nicely presented:)
QG5qrZwl520,I tried 1st one and it’s yummy 😋 my mom appreciated. 😘🥰😍
QG5qrZwl520,Please share dal bori receipe.
QG5qrZwl520,Which flour????wheat or chikpea???

QG5qrZwl520,All reciepes are mouth watering..😋😋
Xzf6oqS0nB4,"This is soooo delicious my mouth is watering, just looking at the video"
Xzf6oqS0nB4,The simplicity of this dish 😍 never tried Bengali food but this recipe is so easy to cook & tempting. I will make it tonight. Can we skip the brinjal??
Xzf6oqS0nB4,"We add ginger and do not fry the fish  , instead when the gravy is prepared cook the fish in the masala and then make jhol"
Xzf6oqS0nB4,"I just tried this today, it was the first time I made this fish and my god, the best decision. It was yummy-licious. At first, i was a little wary because apart from bringal, salt and turmeric there isn't much added and the recipe is quite easy too. I will definitely make it again. Thanks!"
Xzf6oqS0nB4,Always enjoy your cooking ….
Xzf6oqS0nB4,Thank you mam
Xzf6oqS0nB4,Looks so delicious 😋
Xzf6oqS0nB4,same process like ilish mach...why not do the kajli macher jhal with mustered
Xzf6oqS0nB4,In odisha we would normally add a piece of dried mango to thin jhol like this.
Xzf6oqS0nB4,"Total process is perfect, only change is if you not fry the fish ,then the taste of Kajoli will be more"
Xzf6oqS0nB4,Atta na dileo to hobee?
Xzf6oqS0nB4,Wait atta kno diche
Xzf6oqS0nB4,Thanks for bengali dishes🥣
fHAyfU3VFiU,"We are very glad to be able to collaborate with you guys. It was an absolute pleasure working with you guys. Also, this collaboration not only brought us 2 new videos but also 2 new friends. Best wishes always  ❤️❤️"
fHAyfU3VFiU,Curious - why is this called a 'Bengali' recipe? Because of the sugar and potatoes? This recipe doesn't seem to be 'unique' to Bengal
fHAyfU3VFiU,"I think you should start having guests over to your place who would simply be your guests and get to taste the delicious food you cook. Kind of a paid staycation or should we call it “foodcation” . Mane after a tiring Mon to Fri, just take my wife and child and end up at your place for the weekend to have a gastronomic extravaganza !!"
fHAyfU3VFiU,Don't promote Them...They are not belong to our culture of Bengali food...
fHAyfU3VFiU,"I used your recipe today and cooked this dish in picnic but used 5 kg mutton. Honestly speaking, it was so so tasty, so awesome. Thanks for making such delightful recipe. Take love ❤❤❤"
fHAyfU3VFiU,"I did try this recipe…followed it like gospel and prepped it…I think some modifications would make it even better…for example, eliminating Dhone Bata/ reducing yogurt content, which kinda made the dish a bit sour/ adding garam masala a bit earlier/ reducing the quantity of oil (60 mL is too damn high) etc….but overall it turned out decent…would give it a solid 6.75/10"
fHAyfU3VFiU,"Hi , what would per mutton pieces weight ? 30-35gms?"
fHAyfU3VFiU,Your site is down 😢
fHAyfU3VFiU,"I follow your channel to cook many dishes. I made it for my husband when he was sick and it tasted really well. But it took around 3 hours instead of 1.5 hours as mentioned in the video for the mutton to cook properly and become tender. So I could serve dinner much later than I had anticipated. Not that I cooked 1kg, I cooked 750 gms of mutton so ideally it should have taken lesser time and not double the time shown !"
fHAyfU3VFiU,Can you please show us making mete chorchori… mutton liver curry
fHAyfU3VFiU,"Amar ma doi ta deina,tel e mutton er chorbi dito first e,ja thickness r smell.. haat e theke jai"
fHAyfU3VFiU,Bortoman e gas er dam Kolkata te ja tate second option means pressure cooker tai bhalo 😂😂😂😂😂
fHAyfU3VFiU,Beautifully explained.
fHAyfU3VFiU,"Have tried this recipe 5-6 times so, tasty every time!"
fHAyfU3VFiU,I tried this recipe last weekend and it was delicious. Thanks bong eats for sharing love ❤

4ioJtDzQBT0,nice from dhaka
4ioJtDzQBT0,Can they be frozen before frying?
4ioJtDzQBT0,"I remembered my mom used to make samosa 's in these way, she was very hardworking women in my family.. I missed her a lot 😢😢May Allah grant her jannah"
4ioJtDzQBT0,"for a sec I thought this too was pork, then it hit me."
4ioJtDzQBT0,You folks are so great. Precise measurements and temperatures used. It’s a real pleasure to learn on your site. I think one of the best amongst the millions. Keep it up always looking for new recipes first on your site. Do add more recipes in the Indo -Chinese cooking.
4ioJtDzQBT0,I would use filo pastry to make the samosa wraps much more ideal
4ioJtDzQBT0,I was looking for an authentic recipe and I found it.  No turmeric in real kheema samosas lol.  Thank you!
4ioJtDzQBT0,"Delicious..!! 
Sir please also make a video on bohri chiken/mutton biryani"
4ioJtDzQBT0,You guys are the best. Thank you for everything you do.

4ioJtDzQBT0,Wrapper measurements not correct hydration part while making dough.
4ioJtDzQBT0,Please 🥴put your measurements in cups and spoons if possible
4ioJtDzQBT0,"One advise: plss do not chop the coriander leaves so finely because the juices of the leaves , which has a flavour, goes away."
4ioJtDzQBT0,Is there any way to make a vegetarian  filling for the samosa.

jnQgkwVsMgc,This is roti engineering
jnQgkwVsMgc,The rotis turned out fantastic after following this video. They puffed up like proper phulkas even though I had wheat flour with husk and an induction cooktop! Thank you so much for sharing such amazing insights into the art of roti making!
jnQgkwVsMgc,"I'm in such shock; I can't believe that I actually succeeded at making phulka roti after watching this video! And it was soft still the next day! My family is from Assam, so rotis have been an experiment after eating mostly rice all my life."
jnQgkwVsMgc,This much amount of water made my flour moist .. so couldn’t roll it properly

jnQgkwVsMgc,"Animation, video special effects,  tips on screen, video angle were excellent"
jnQgkwVsMgc,Is there any other way to get them to puff up. We have an electric stove. The flat glass kind.
jnQgkwVsMgc,Going to make rotis..... First time pray for me🥴
jnQgkwVsMgc,Good scientific explanation 👍 keep it up. Nice video.
jnQgkwVsMgc,First time tried to make roti was a disaster but after watching your video I realised I was doing it all wrong. This time rotis came out so soft. I did it. Thankyou so much ❤
jnQgkwVsMgc,Why do my rotis always come out a little hard?
jnQgkwVsMgc,Why is it so beautiful??❤
jnQgkwVsMgc,Amazing tips. However what if I have an induction stove only?

kCR9zDpou9Y,What a thumbnail!

kCR9zDpou9Y,Cool 😎😎😎💖💖💖
kCR9zDpou9Y,Nice.. Looks testy..
kCR9zDpou9Y,How long should we marinate the fish ?
kCR9zDpou9Y,Ilish er tel ta thik jomlo na.
kCR9zDpou9Y,Yummy 🤤😋
kCR9zDpou9Y,"I have made a mistake: When it reached the smoking point, I haven't cooled down the oil but cooked the fish straight away...  is that  toxic?! I cooked a large batch not sure if I have to throw that fish or nothing happen if I eat it this time! Could you please let me know?!"
kCR9zDpou9Y,"I'm part-Bengali and my mom who is Bengali is paralysed now and cant cook. She used to make these simple fried fish on Sundays. I would look forward to the guy vending fish on his bicycle every Sunday (along with my pet dog who would figure out he's coming even when he was a whole street away 😂) Reminded me of my childhood. Thankyou for bringing back those wonderful memories. Truly, with all the elaborate fish based recipes out there in the world, they will never compare to this simple delicious dish."
kCR9zDpou9Y,Wow... Lovely.. Mouth watering 💖💖💖
kCR9zDpou9Y,"I don't like deep fried hilsha fish. I like shallow fry, pathuri and vapa Hilsha. By now you know my taste.  Those who live abroad buy frozen Hilsha  should dip in salt water to  neutralize formalin in Hilsha. Especially Bangladeshi fish exporters use formalin to preserve fish for longer life and look. That's what I found out online. However that chemical once ingested  can be very harmful. I usually dip the   scaled   hilsha fish steaks in salt water overnight. in Refrigerator   That also makes the fish  moist and cured . Next day I wash with cold water and marinate with Turmeric powder mustard oil and salt . then broil lightly in oven. The Fish is moist and soft and so tasty. you can't imagine When I  tried first  time I was really amazed .  I recommend you to try at least once.  may be couple of steaks and let me know."
ABcJVlglEXo,"HOW TO MAKE A GOOD MUSTARD PASTE THAT IS NOT BITTER: 
- Start by soaking the mustard in water for two hours (at least). 
- Strain and then grind the mustard in a grinder or on a shil nora along with green chillies and salt.
- Depending on the size of your grinder jar, you need to take sufficient quantity of mustard seeds so that it comes up above the blades. Otherwise your paste won't be smooth enough.
- Grind patiently until your mustard resembles the consistency of sandalwood paste. The brown mustard skins should look like specks or dots and no bigger.
- Taste the paste. If it is not noticeably bitter, congratulations! You have made respectable mustard paste fit for a Bengali dish. The tiny hint of bitterness will go away when we cook the mustard.

PS. This is not relevant to this recipe, but sauteing mustard paste in oil DOES NOT turn it bitter. It is a food myth. That only happens if your mustard paste is bitter to begin with."
ABcJVlglEXo,Everything was perfect but I would not prefer coconut flavor in my bhapa ilish. Because coconut will diminish the strong flavor of mustard.
ABcJVlglEXo,wow yummy so beautiful I like it thank you so much Appi ❤❤ 4:33
ABcJVlglEXo,I think you guys introduced this ASMR thing way before anyone knew🥰🥰
ABcJVlglEXo,Its way better to put the tiffin box with boiling rice. ( seal the tiffin box tightly)
ABcJVlglEXo,Very good message. ❤
ABcJVlglEXo,I didn't effort hilsha above 500gm plise provide me
ABcJVlglEXo,The best part is that you measure
ABcJVlglEXo,"I still remember how first time eat this dish, from then everytime my father buy ""Eilish"" I always prefer this dish. It's so delicious 😋😋"
ABcJVlglEXo,At our house it's a custom not to eat ilish from laxmi puja to saraswati puja(October to February more or less) and we obey the custom... 😊
ABcJVlglEXo,Where buy this tiffin box online?
ABcJVlglEXo,"Also, once you cut out the fish from the bati, you should have showed us the thickness of the gravy."
ABcJVlglEXo,Salt 22gm?? Really?
ABcJVlglEXo,100 gm water??? It is too much. I think water proportion is not right. Isnt it?
ABcJVlglEXo,What absolutely the oil???

6-IQrxibfiI,"Amazing recipe and I truly love the way you guys explain everything (including msg will NOT kill us, lol)...1 humble request if you guys can always input teaspoons, tablespoons and cups as measurements as it's a pain going back and forth on Google for conversions and also some of us don't have measuring spoons or weight scales? Just fyi. Thanks and keep up the great work."
6-IQrxibfiI,"Great recipe. I have a question 

Should I double the ingredient mass for 500g and 4x mass for 1kg chicken?"

OPAIFY_4Wrg,"Ap kon c saffron use kiye hai 
Kis brand ki"
OPAIFY_4Wrg,Looks yummy. This much amount serve for how many  person?
OPAIFY_4Wrg,where did you find those terracotta?
OPAIFY_4Wrg,My grandmother used to heat a small ladle then add toast the saffron strands after switching off the heat. She would remove the saffron strands to another very small bowl after a 30 secs . She would then just crush the saffron with her hand. It would crumble and become a powder. This she added to the dish. She said you won't get saffron strands in your mouth and it is distributed evenly throughout the dish.
OPAIFY_4Wrg,Can I use glass bowl?
OPAIFY_4Wrg,Can I use gobindobhog ?
OPAIFY_4Wrg,In case if I have not this mud utensils  then ?
OPAIFY_4Wrg,Love the music👌🏻
OPAIFY_4Wrg,How many servings in 1lt
OPAIFY_4Wrg,Famouse.   In.   World.

vO2rMXq_ac8,This much masala is sufficient for how many kgs mutton biryani?
vO2rMXq_ac8,Acha
vO2rMXq_ac8,Dada ai mosla r quantity ta koto gram rice er jonno appropriate???(like 500gm/1kg)?? pls reply deben..
vO2rMXq_ac8,This spice for how much quantity purpose
vO2rMXq_ac8,I am watching your channel for quite some time and i want to say something is that you grind gota masala or whole spices in mixture grinder but while doing so what you are doing is that you are breaking the spices in small bits but not actually grinding them so for actual gring either you should use hamam dista or sheel pata this way you will gring the spices and make them release the actual scent or flavour you tend to use them for....
vO2rMXq_ac8,I use this method totally and it turns out awesome.
vO2rMXq_ac8,Can we skip the white pepper?
vO2rMXq_ac8,The biriyani masala prepared for what quantity of meat?
vO2rMXq_ac8,Will you guys please show the recipe for Kolkata Chicken Biriyani??
vO2rMXq_ac8,"You two are proud representation of Bengal to an international audience. Your humbleness blend with authenticity is like your biryani spice - just right without being overpowering. Plus you two are cute together. 
If you are still in San Francisco and plan to travel to Boston - would be fun to cook outdoor on a mud stove and wood fire  like Bengal country sides - try recipes like maacher paturi and begun pora."
vO2rMXq_ac8,Please share chicken chaap & biryani
vO2rMXq_ac8,Please make a chicken biryani recipe..
vO2rMXq_ac8,its better not to include cloves in the biryani masala and add dried rose petals in the masala too..
vO2rMXq_ac8,Chicken biriyani r recipe ta dile khub bhalo hoy. Please @bongeats akta chicken biriyani Recipe chai
SbWGXcZTYzg,"⭐⭐⭐UPDATE: 24 June 2018: Biryani version 1.1—We made our Calcutta mutton biryani again today and it turned out even better than the day we filmed the video! What did we change? Read on.

1. We increased the salt in the water for boiling rice from 30 to 45 grams, since we felt the rice needed a little more salt in our previous version. This is something that one of our viewers, Titir Banerjee, had also pointed out in her comment after giving our recipe a try. 

2. When pressure cooking the mutton we placed the potatoes at the bottom instead of the top. This led to even juicer and flavourful potatoes this time (and no, the potatoes did not melt). 

3. We reduced the meetha attar to 4 drops from 5. This seems to be the perfect balance of aromatics.

We have updated the website (https://www.bongeats.com/recipe/kolkata-mutton-biryani ) with these changes. 

Biryani really gets better with practice so keep trying to get better!"
SbWGXcZTYzg,"I was wondering if you could give the measurements of the spices and ginger and garlic and all other ingredients with respect to teaspoon and tablespoon.
 For those who cannot afford a scale."
SbWGXcZTYzg,Long back I saw a video of a Pakistani gentleman showing the process of making a calcutta biryani. Can't seem to find it now.
SbWGXcZTYzg,Shall I be putting it directly on flame for dum? @Bong Eats
SbWGXcZTYzg,This biryani u made is for how many people?
SbWGXcZTYzg,Awesome i will make it tomorrow 😊❤
SbWGXcZTYzg,Hello. Has anyone adapted this to make chicken biriyani? Please tell me how you went about it. 🫰🏾🤌🏾
SbWGXcZTYzg,You make everything look so easy. Definitely gonna try thisssssssssss
SbWGXcZTYzg,Please do a kolkata style chicken biryani
SbWGXcZTYzg,unnecessary things are added to make it complicated
SbWGXcZTYzg,The MOST SERIOUS biriyani making video one have ever seen in Internet.
SbWGXcZTYzg,is there any replacement for khowa kheer ? and alubokhara (not sure what it's called )
SbWGXcZTYzg,Please make chicken biriyani because in my family mutton comes rarely but chicken is more regular... Please and my brother loves chicken biriyani I want to make for him
SbWGXcZTYzg,"Ur videos are just amazing, I have never known much about Bengali cuisine, not a fan tbh, but it has so much culture behind it... and so much love and hard work goes in ur videos :)"
SbWGXcZTYzg,"I have followed the repice ,the result is excellent. Everyone praised. Thank you bing eats"

IzfEnYxzjUg,I m try the recipe but not well.. i think bay leaves not  suitable for this dish

IzfEnYxzjUg,"Hello, please what is radhuni ?"
KBGgeBM22BM,Please do a collab with @Lost & rare recipes
KBGgeBM22BM,Wow!! Fantastic
KBGgeBM22BM,Pragyasundari devi was the wife of reknown writer of assam laxminath bezbaruah. This is how assam is connected with thakurbari.
KBGgeBM22BM,May I know where you buy your saffron from
KBGgeBM22BM,"I wish someone would translate Pragya Sundari Debi's books to English,so that non bengali readers might also have access to them!"
KBGgeBM22BM,"Awesome, but require traditional dishes"
KBGgeBM22BM,"Actually, Pragyasundari Debi's books are a three-part series. The third part is not called Amish o Niramish Ranna, but Jarak: Achar o Chatni and so a lot of people being unaware only by the first two parts. It is also published by Ananda like the other two parts.
Looking forward to some recipes from the second and third part as well."
KBGgeBM22BM,Never heard of these combinations before but definitely will give a try
KBGgeBM22BM,Recipe is very nice and is shown in a very easy manner . But can we make 'Bhater Kofta Curry ' as well ?
KBGgeBM22BM,Is this mashed biryani
KBGgeBM22BM,"That 1 pot of saffron can you please tell the cost?
I have tried your many recipe.They were really good.☺😉"
KBGgeBM22BM,Reminds me of Italian arancini.

G4Igr5VwEEQ,"not only for Bengali, this channel is the best!! Just loved the timeline here..its extremely useful, logical. The best!! in every ways"
G4Igr5VwEEQ,"I made this recipe exactly as per this video. But it was disappointing that my mocha turned out to be bitter :( 

They should have added a disclaimer saying how much of the younger part of the mocha can be used."
G4Igr5VwEEQ,Jokhn e bhabhi aj aita banabo recipe dekhte hobe tokhn tomader channel khulle sob problem amar solve hoe jay. Thank you ❤❤❤

G4Igr5VwEEQ,Wow....that was kinda tutorial....I used to hate making this bcoz of the sticky feeling even after washing hands several times...but you made it a cakewalk now and so many ingredients to make it tasty...phew.....Thank you for this wonderful dish.
qbZRmBc3y9M,"I finally made the Kachkolar kofta! l’ll be honest, I doubled the recipe and they were so good that we just ate half of them with dipping sauces (ketchup, sour cream). So satisfying and tasty! Because I’ve moved recently I couldn’t find my maida so I used rice flour and it was epically crunchy. And I also accidentally underboiled the plantains so it was pretty lumpy but they still fried up just fine. 

Anyway I’ll make the dalna (and the Khosha chochchori) with the rest of the kofta tomorrow. 😂 Thanks bong eats for making me try recipes that I would normally think are too much effort."
qbZRmBc3y9M,"Khub bhalo hoyeche khete, specially jhol ta, thank u for such a wonderful recipe ☺️"
qbZRmBc3y9M,Potato without biryani and your voice without recipe..donoi bekar😢😂😂
qbZRmBc3y9M,"Impossible to peel these Kanch Kola raw.  So that is how you peel them, cook first!  Got it.
Bengalis are so frugal.  Using up the peel is a wonderful idea.  These plantains have a lot of potassium mineral in them.

fyi - I find the background music extremely stressful to hear continuously.  I usually don't subscribe to any channel with music.  It is unnecessary, a constant irritant, and you would do well to remove it entirely. It serves no purpose but to annoy and hurts the ears with excess sound.  Have you seen those cooking channels with no voice and no music?  Dindigul Food Court is one, and there are some Japanese channels too.  Its very Zen to have only natural sounds of cooking and nothing else.  Please use this model.  Its taxing to have music forced upon one's ears when trying to learn a recipe.  Music is a personal choice."
qbZRmBc3y9M,4 mins fry one side or both?
qbZRmBc3y9M,"Love love the recipe, this is how its made at home ❤❤"
qbZRmBc3y9M,Can i skip the coconut?
qbZRmBc3y9M,A silence can make so many beautiful pictures ☺️

67SE2Zg2AJI,My mother had asked a Bengali wedding caterer about the recipe for this dish. This is about 25 yrs ago and I was 12. When my mother asked about proportions and measurements he started laughing. He said it was all aandaj. He said he has been catering for moe than   20 years and never ever needed any measurements.

Ia2MzLxJhno,What is SHORSHE BATA ????

VjVYttymMTA,Which is your favourite place for chilli pork? What is your favourite thing to eat with chilli pork?
VjVYttymMTA,From where i can get fresh pork like this ? @BongEats
VjVYttymMTA,Ok it looks good but it looked like it took 5 hours to prep an cook a fast meal
VjVYttymMTA,"I absolutely love your recipes and each one that I have tried has come out remarkably well - that too for someone who hardly ever cooks anything. However, I have one feedback-all your measurements are usually in grams making it rather difficult for anyone without a digital measuring equipment. Request you to kindly share measurements in spoon/cups too. Thank you 🙏🏼"
VjVYttymMTA,"Very well explained! A little concerned with the number of green chilies, may need to adjust. Thanks"
VjVYttymMTA,Great recipe for Tibetan Pork Chilli…Dolma aunty is a Tibetan living in India. Thank u for the video. ❤
VjVYttymMTA,I love Chilli Pork !!! The softy fat portion is my favourite❤❤
VjVYttymMTA,Super thank you
VjVYttymMTA,How to measure oil in grams?
VjVYttymMTA,That's an interesting recipe.
VjVYttymMTA,If I want to swap chicken for pork..keeping rest of the recipe same..how to do the initial steaming of the chicken ?
VjVYttymMTA,from where can we buy good quality pork?
VjVYttymMTA,"Thanks for the recipe , gonna try it , Do you get rid of the pork stock completely and not use it ?"
VjVYttymMTA,"The fact that you don't use the pork stalk is the stupidest idea I've ever followed blindly, guessing you all are seasoned cooks and you'd know better.

Waste of my pork and my dinner."
VjVYttymMTA,Fat free pork is just boring
doLrVyqkiLg,🙏This recipe is the one I like the most!
doLrVyqkiLg,Eta chic hoto not ghonto
doLrVyqkiLg,"Rarely seen such a lovely and holistic approach to making a video on any cuisine. Your cooking ingredients, process of chopping, frying and serving food with the captions,  natural sound of cooking, and the background music makes it unique. Not to forget the descriptions you write later,of the recipes... which add more flavour to your ghontos and other torkaris. Kudos. Carry on with more fantastic productions of Bengali cuisine."
doLrVyqkiLg,Seem ba beans ek noy…seem flat beans and what you cooking those are French beans or ring beans
doLrVyqkiLg,"@BongEats - I liked your entire response to others contradicting the dish. But why use labels like “crazies”. Your point was so well-written. Why then the need to use derogatory labels on such an otherwise properly written decent response 🙏 
People insisting on a certain spice makes them stubborn. If you were to use adjectives at least use the proper one - say they are tunnel-visioned or close-minded. Calling a person crazy attacks the mental health of a person and that’s used recklessly by many with perhaps limited vocabulary and cant. But I know you are cultured and well-versed."
doLrVyqkiLg,Simply love your recipes. Thank you Bongeats❤❤
doLrVyqkiLg,I made this today...my family loved it ❤❤
doLrVyqkiLg,"My husband and I love your videos. They educate us and make us learn to cook. And the taste is just like home, even when we are not"
doLrVyqkiLg,I’ve been thinking about cooking this since I saw it .. finally made it yesterday and it turned out to be so good. Really loved the flavour of kalo jeere and mustard oil flavour in it .. this is not something we’d usually have in Bangladesh! Thanks a bunch for this recipe!

2ARM9JhfXsg,"Today I have tried this at home and the taste was Amaizing!So rich,creamy texture all together it was Fabulous!Thanks for this Amaizing recipe!I made payesh a lot of time but this time I succeeded in  making perfect payesh!"
2ARM9JhfXsg,I would love to make this payesh for my baby's annaprashan. My mother was the best cook I knew and I never learnt how to cook from her. All your recipes remind me of her and make me feel like she's still around. Can you please suggest how I can modify this recipe to make it without the nolen gur since it isn't the season for it? Many thanks for all the effort you make.
2ARM9JhfXsg,"I tried this recipe twice but somehow I managed to make a mistake each time :( I don't remember what went wrong the first time, but this time it was too liquid and didn't thicken enough though I followed the time guidelines and more. Also, the rice and milk feel kind of separate. Any advice? I am in the USA and using the best ingredients I can source locally (ie regular basmati rice not the rice we use in India for payesh). I do have idli rice - if that helps?"
oTrxOqVd7-I,Parshe is not my cup of tea. Probably I'll make it with pabda or maybe bhola. Two of my favorites. But loved this recipe
oTrxOqVd7-I,"How beautifully presented the whole recipe.... I'm sure taste is awesome and the presentation of the recipe and the background music, a piece of art..... ❤"
oTrxOqVd7-I,My parshe maach breaks while  frying... Can you please suggest right way to fry any fish?
oTrxOqVd7-I,Can we skip the yogurt in this recipe?
oTrxOqVd7-I,I am a maharashtrian and we use mustard only for tadka. We never use mustard oil for cooking. I love your channel and i always watch ur recipes but never tried any of ur recipes (guilty). I loved this recipe and really wanted to try it but I was sceptical ki itni Rai kaisi taste karegi. I gathered courage and tried the recipe and loved it ❤❤❤ every body loved it.

lgKT3avl8j0,"The recipe was great but adding ketchup means you can’t technically call it “niramish”, since there’s garlic in ketchup, right?"
lgKT3avl8j0,It's really amazing 👏

VOKgeZMwrv4,I made this recipe many times it's delicious
VOKgeZMwrv4,Can I use anything else instead of eggs?
VOKgeZMwrv4,Wanted to make this for some pure-veg friends. What is the alternative of using egg-wash for the final coating?
VOKgeZMwrv4,When u add Egg how come is this a vegetable chop? Are u kidding . Fundamental mistake
Cd0x661PujE,"NO BAKING POWDER? This cake does not use baking powder, baking soda or any leavening agent. That is because this is an old-fashioned cake that is rich, dense, moist and heavy. Look at the cross section of the cake in the video, you will see there are no air-pockets. If you are looking for a light spongy cake, this recipe is not for you."
Cd0x661PujE,Making my cake following this recipe since 2018 and I never looked for any other recipe.
Cd0x661PujE,@BongEats It will be even better if you leave links to the fabulous equipment you always use.
Cd0x661PujE,"Thank you so much for this recipe. We just followed it right now and loved it. Thank you, Merry Christmas 🎄, and Happy New Year!!"
Cd0x661PujE,"Your recipe is so easy to follow and the ingredients are easily available. I followed it and baked a cake this Christmas. It turned out to be yummy 😋

Cd0x661PujE,"Can you use a different cake tin for this recipe.  If yes, what size?  This is the best cake recipe I have tried so far.  Thanks."
Cd0x661PujE,The recipe is Amazing! Though I’m curious about the music? I loved it. Which music is playing in the video?
Cd0x661PujE,This is my 3rd time baking this cake. Missed baking last year because of my trip to India. So the fruits were soaked for a Year but the cake still tastes awesome 👌👌👌👌. But my only dissatisfaction every time is the color of the cake. My cake doesn’t turn out as brown as yours. Any advice?
Cd0x661PujE,It would be good to give the  details of the measurements of the cake
Cd0x661PujE,It's time for this legendary video once again....
Cd0x661PujE,Salted or unsalted butter you used?
Cd0x661PujE,We dont consume alcohol..wt do you suggest soaking with aftr cake is done?
Cd0x661PujE,Hey bongeats. What to do if I don’t have this size pan. If I divide the batter in two pans will the cooking time remain the same ?
Cd0x661PujE,"Coming back to this video every year since it's release and thank you everytime for making the best plum cake recipe available! It's taste, warmth and appeal is so magical and feels like a piece of Christmas itself that I send out to the loved ones! Thank you both and best wishes for the season! ❤"

MtcAg-5SeT8,Not watch this channel high on zaza.
MtcAg-5SeT8,"Bong eats, I follow you for a while now and super happy with what you present to us. It’s funny how our world has gone so small and I am watching your video from Chicago this Thursday afternoon and using your cooking tips to make cholar dal, which I never learned when I was around my mom 😊 thank you !!"
MtcAg-5SeT8,"For someone who hates cooking, these videos are almost like a spiritual journey."
MtcAg-5SeT8,"this is one of the best instructional videos I've seen.  POV, clear, typography great, what's not to like?  plus I cooked the recipe and it was awesome.  about to do it again right now."
MtcAg-5SeT8,Video is too good
MtcAg-5SeT8,"I am a bachelor with the less than 6 months of Cooking experience. 
Whenever I decide to cook something, no matter how less resources I have , I always end up checking out a Bong Eats version for every recipe. 
I have failed to replicate their recipes each time, but their videos are therapeutic and motivating enough for me to come back again with another failed attempt. 🤲"
MtcAg-5SeT8,Loved your recipe 👌🏻👌🏻 but have a question to ask that can I use butter instead of ghee at the end??
MtcAg-5SeT8,Bong Eats taught me cooking five years back when I started my journey in a new city. My go-to channel for Bengali cooking. :)

l30g5BEOgpA,Really you called this momo chutney!!!??👎👎👎
2F0PDf1wM1Q,"From the day I started watching this channel... I have fallen in love with food as a whole... and the whole concept of celebrating food, what we do in bengal... Momos or dumplings, as called in different parts of the world... has been an absolute pride for Calcutta... As my father keeps telling me about the bygone days when he used to have dumplings in China town, and for those ignorant sick people.. who are so worried about the type of meat being used here... fyi the innocent chicken came into bengali platter much later than mutton... and many zamidars and royals due to the influence of chinese and british used to have pork also... my maternal Uncle who is 78 now used to have pork on almost daily basis.. and is still cooked in his place..  which I love to have whenever I visit my mamabari, and I am a hindu(if at all it comes to that)!"
2F0PDf1wM1Q,Please people it’s MOMO NOT MOMOS WTF
2F0PDf1wM1Q,The song with recipe❤
2F0PDf1wM1Q,"I just tried this with chicken to make the broth. And what a wonderful dish for winters. Soon to become a staple at home. I added a little garlic powder to the boiling water. And some coriander stalks along with spring onion at the end. 
Any suggestions on the carrot and onion used. I’m planning to use them for carrot soup. But not sure if the flavours would get changed"
2F0PDf1wM1Q,Amar dakha best soup 🍲 recipe 😋ami try korbo
2F0PDf1wM1Q,After straining out the soup what can be done with those vegetables and bony pcs ? discard ?
2F0PDf1wM1Q,can i use same method and ingredients for chicken soup also?
2F0PDf1wM1Q,"Everything is ok but the soup contains a great concentration of poached egg white, speaking about the Calcutta style momo soup that we are familiar with! Well, i tried it either way and I think that the one with the eggs makes the cut so it would be better if you also include it...Nothing much just heat up the soup after straining and add some egg whites[acc to your choice] and then enjoy it...Now I know that I am a kid and most of you will ignore my advice but I am a kinda good chef and my advice is worth it!"
2F0PDf1wM1Q,Best chaneel banglar bong eats ❤😘
2F0PDf1wM1Q,"U wasting those tasty legs as well that's stupid,omg just to make a soup."
2F0PDf1wM1Q,Very bad! You are showing us pork
2F0PDf1wM1Q,Love your recipes! Just a suggestion...wouldn't it be nice to add a bit of sesame oil and/or chilli oil right at the end before serving?
2F0PDf1wM1Q,"Excellent!!!!

2F0PDf1wM1Q,Bengalisss not eattt porkksss sooo plzzz   not make vdos on wht bengali eat
2F0PDf1wM1Q,Being a bangali how can you eat pork !!!!!!
hVRRaYjjUis,Your videos are one of several regular reminders of how grateful I am to be back in Kolkata. <3
hVRRaYjjUis,Can pork be replaced with chicken in this recipe?
hVRRaYjjUis,chicken pokora recipe please
hVRRaYjjUis,Can I use mutton instead of pork?
hVRRaYjjUis,Tomra jodi pasta recipe share koro khb valo hy.without cheese
hVRRaYjjUis,Cooking is not the problem... If only I could cut vegetables so perfectly 🥲
hVRRaYjjUis,"I have tried out this recipe and it turned out really well, but I want to know how to make the momos softer like the ones we get in restaurants, should I steam it for a longer period or use a different kind of flour??"
hVRRaYjjUis,What fat to use in chicken momo
hVRRaYjjUis,Can I try this with beef?
hVRRaYjjUis,I tried this recipe. Perfect very tasty. Watched all the three videos. Momos came a bit dry probably as fat was less. Please advise how to get soft succulent momos
hVRRaYjjUis,"Kindly give measurements in spoon in your recipes. I mean for vegetables, garlic mention how many cloves, medium onion, number of green chilies etc., it will help your channel grow.  The chutney recipe also mention number of chilies please. Most people don’t have weighing scale for grams measurement"
hVRRaYjjUis,"Ei steamer ta kotha theke kinechen
Please reply"
hVRRaYjjUis,I love all your recipes. Love the momo one too. But I don’t think one should put chillies in momos. No authentic recipe has chillies. If you need spice they sauce is there for that reason too.
hVRRaYjjUis,"Which Bengali eats pork!!
It’s not halal…."
hVRRaYjjUis,Wow amazing recipe 👌👌👌👌 l really like this video. Thank you for sharing. Your work very well and you are very talented 🙏🙏 May God bless you and all time happy your life 😊😊🙏🙏🙏🙏
hVRRaYjjUis,"I made this recipi with the same method so many times. Believe me it wasss freakin delicious, i cant brlieve that i made same street styles momos😁😁😍😍"
GNA1tpQ7dr0,Stupid… too much formal… it’s not that much tough 😂
GNA1tpQ7dr0,Can we store this wrap?
GNA1tpQ7dr0,Great teaching video!
GNA1tpQ7dr0,Why are my momos never white. It looks gray or brownish i dont know but weired🙁
GNA1tpQ7dr0,this is the level of detail i expect in cooking videos. finally.
GNA1tpQ7dr0,Super clear explanation. Only video so detailed. Thank you. God bless!
GNA1tpQ7dr0,What if I roll the dough out over the entire surface and cut it all out with a circular cutter 😅
GNA1tpQ7dr0,Can I stored this wrapper ? For 1 days
GNA1tpQ7dr0,Why still becomes chewy not soft like vendors? Any tips for that? Follow the exact instructions of the video still the se result.
GNA1tpQ7dr0,Eto plastic kn bebohar koren apnara ekta halka wet cloth diye dheke rakhlei toh hoy.
GNA1tpQ7dr0,Hi how to store these wrappers ?
GNA1tpQ7dr0,Dont we have to add oil?
GNA1tpQ7dr0,In the dough where is oil🛢️?
GNA1tpQ7dr0,And cook for 20 minutes 42.30 seconds
GNA1tpQ7dr0,When as a civil engineer made a momos 😂😂
GNA1tpQ7dr0,this is so unreal 😂😂
Wgrv5ithNrg,"ATTENTION CHRISTMAS CAKE BAKERS: We've put up a list of ingredients and equipment on our website, https://bongeats.com/recipe/calcutta-christmas-fruitcake/."
Wgrv5ithNrg,❤❤❤❤❤ love you both
Wgrv5ithNrg,Can we soak petha in this? And can we use orange juice to soak the fruits??
Wgrv5ithNrg,Insia resembles Anushka Sharma
Wgrv5ithNrg,"Hi... just came acros this video and am going to try this out this year.  Already soaked the fruits.
Very nice explanation.
One question - once we soak the fruits, can the container be opened in between or it should it be fully airtight and closed for the entire 20-30 days?"
Wgrv5ithNrg,Cant understand Indians
Wgrv5ithNrg,Alcohol is haram in my religion.. can you please share other substitutes for alcohol?
Wgrv5ithNrg,This is my third year of cooking this cake. It is our yearly ritual now.
Wgrv5ithNrg,3:43 Can I bake this cake without alcohol? Please please please reply bong eats 🙏🥺🥺
Wgrv5ithNrg,Soaking starts 😊
Wgrv5ithNrg,"wow !! You did a great job of making the cake, it made me want to eat it 😀"
Wgrv5ithNrg,I just ❤ you guys..one thing I know it’s the ritual and authentic way to prepare the fruits this way..but will it be ok for the children 👶
Wgrv5ithNrg,Who is here while soaking fruits in 2022 ! :)
Wgrv5ithNrg,Your cooking skills are amazing
Wgrv5ithNrg,New to baking..can someone help me with some shops in New Market for these baking supplies ??
Wgrv5ithNrg,I made it for the last two years
Wgrv5ithNrg,What knife used to chopping?
Wgrv5ithNrg,I’ve been making Christmas cake for a couple of years now and the most interesting part about it is that each recipe is different. There’s no one way on how to make it. Each family has a slightly different preference. I’ve been trying to match my Nan’s version and I’m getting so close.
KUUOwNouiPA,"Please share Bengali rasogolla, I'm egarly waiting for this from ur channel"
KUUOwNouiPA,"Love your recipes, Can you please share the recipe for perfect spongy rasgulla please... ❤️🙏"
KUUOwNouiPA,"what if the milk is already curdled somehow? Is it needed to add vinegar to it then? if so, then how much?
also, what do you do with the leftover whey?"
KUUOwNouiPA,"How do you compact it into a rectangle so that it can be cut into cubes for, say, palak paneer or matar paneer?"
KUUOwNouiPA,Thanks
KUUOwNouiPA,Please upload chhanar jalebi recipe too..
KUUOwNouiPA,My mother used to use Calcium Lactate or the whey from a previous batch of paneer.
KUUOwNouiPA,Plz share paneer butter masks recipient💓💓💓
KUUOwNouiPA,"Process of making paneer is different  frm cheena
In paneer once milk starts boiling add lime or vinegar or salt water at a time on high flames it will curdles 
Cheena is made lime vinegar  is added slowly  slowly multiple times on slow flame so curdling will be slow small particles are formed
Historically  paaneer is brought by mughals to north 
While cheena brought by Portuguese  to bengal"
KUUOwNouiPA,Your recipe was mindblowing

CUCtn02Juk0,"I love how simple the instructions were. First time mutton kosha successful, thank you for creating such non fussy recipe content"
CUCtn02Juk0,Can I boil mutton in pressure cooker before making this curry??
CUCtn02Juk0,This is amazing. Super detailed ! Loved this. Definitely going to try this out. ❤
CUCtn02Juk0,The recipe was mindblowing!The way you guided throughout made it even easier.I cooked it for a family get-together today and people just loved it😊😊Thank you😊😊😊
CUCtn02Juk0,5 hours of cooking
CUCtn02Juk0,Please give up Non veg . Joy Shree Ram
CUCtn02Juk0,The calmness in this video is amazing
CUCtn02Juk0,You suggest not to marinate meat as per your update on your website. In that case should we increase the spices and amount of ginger garlic etc for the curry? Add the quantities for the marinade as well? Thanks
CUCtn02Juk0,Nothing beats kosha mangsho with rice for Sunday afternoon meal.
CUCtn02Juk0,"Are you a film maker the sound, music , editing, graphics and of course the detailing that went into the cooking"

CUCtn02Juk0,"Hi, not sure if you'll read this comment but I wanted to share a personal experience. I married into a Bengali family and I knew very little about Bengali food. It is been three years and I always come back to this recipe and the love that goes into making this. My husband absolutely loves this recipe and swears by it too! On top of it all, his family was visiting from the US earlier this year and I made this for them and they told me it's the best mutton curry they've had! 

 All the love and patience that goes into making Kosha is soself-rewarding. I cannot thank you enough for this lovely recipe!"
CUCtn02Juk0,Thank you!
CUCtn02Juk0,Save button is disabled!!! 🙁
CUCtn02Juk0,"I've made this recipe many times so far and this is my review:

May God bless you, this recipe and this platform for making this available to us all. Thank you so much. This is my favourite lamb curry, my younger sister doesn't like red meat because she has dental issues but this. Even she can't resist. If any one reading this is second guessing if the time to make this is worth it or not. It is. Make it. Make it, feed it to your loved ones and be loved even more. You won't be looking for any other Meat Curry ever. It's insanely good 👍❤"
CUCtn02Juk0,I am hungry at midnight
CUCtn02Juk0,Make a video of teaching about mutton buying guide and type of goat to identify.
Lx50WRubCcM,Skipping the yogurt part and adding a decent amount of ghee before finishing... It will work out well
Lx50WRubCcM,Made this dish today.. and it was amazing.. just added bit of coriander for a dash of flavor.
Lx50WRubCcM,"love your recipes, but more paneer videos please . :) i could find only one in this channel."
Lx50WRubCcM,Proti bar ei recipe dekhei ranna Kori r ashadharon test hoi thank for beautiful recipe.
Lx50WRubCcM,"Followed your recipe today for lunch! Turned out scrumptuous :D Thank you Insiya & Saptarshi, you guys are doing an amazing job at this!"
Lx50WRubCcM,"I don't get why the amounts are mentioned in g,mm,cm.. we are in the kitchen not a scientific laboratory.. I think it will be better if you can use easier measurements like 2 potatoes instead of ... g of potato!!"
Lx50WRubCcM,Hii…… I made it today and it tasted yummmmm !!!!!! Thanks for sharing ❤
Lx50WRubCcM,"I am an avid follower of your channel , love your recipes , but I am unable to fathom why capsicum in a  niramish Bengali style Chhanar dalna , never heard of or seen in our maa er kitchens or traditional Bangali homes too..."
Lx50WRubCcM,"Instead of paneer and capsicum,green matar can I put only aloo"
Lx50WRubCcM,I have tried this recipe and it was tasty and also light .. I cooked for my family members and they enjoyed it ❤
Lx50WRubCcM,Absolutely fantastic outcome! Thank you so much. Keep up the great work! Bengali vegetarian for the win! Hare Krsna!
Lx50WRubCcM,"My mom makes it kind of similar, except she used tomato and capcisum puree and doesn't use yogurt. Tastes delicious. She also adds a spoon of ghee."
ZveiVet2ENk,Dal take onion dia boil krar reason ta ki?
ZveiVet2ENk,Can we make it with green peas with this same recipe
ZveiVet2ENk,"❤ Awesome I have tried many of your dishes,all are awesome!!

ZveiVet2ENk,"I just made this but I added lemon juice for tangy taste and avoid coconut cause that wasn't available. Came out so well, thank you so much for sharing this recipe! ❤❤❤"
ZveiVet2ENk,I always follow for recipes & ❤ this channel. I prefer this one the most..
ZveiVet2ENk,"Important TIP : In addition to weight ,please mention spices in tsp/tbsp and dal etc in cups."
ZveiVet2ENk,"This tastes lovely, though I like the boiled version without oil"
ZveiVet2ENk,"Bengalis chop vegetables very artistically. The way a plate of chopped vegetables is kept,looks very aesthetic"
ZveiVet2ENk,"There’s a different take on ghugni - it shouldn’t be soft otherwise it approximates chhole in texture.
The best bara-ghugni shops in bhubaneswar serve a firm ghugni and most prefer it to a softer version."
lXU5Y0KVV2s,Thank you for sharing the authentic recipes!

lXU5Y0KVV2s,"I happened to watch this episode today. Sorry! But it was amazing to know you guys. You guys have the next door couple feeling  which attracts me the most. Being a Bangal myself I can relate to all the recepies that you guys cook.
Keep cooking . Much Love♡"
lXU5Y0KVV2s,Yes. You should’ve specified. Lot of nuts running around…
lXU5Y0KVV2s,"I consult Bong Eats a lot. I was having all sorts of questions, such as, wanted to see the face of the beautiful hands which prepares the such amazing dishes with proper techniques. I just happen to fall into this video totally by chance today, five years after you recorded it. It is so nice to finally see the face which goes with the hands 😁. People asked you all the questions I had and then some. Are you two back in Kolkata now?  I realized your logic for using the measurements in metric but I get very frustrated to constantly asking google to convert those to English system as I live here in the US. Is there any way you can also incorporate both systems for future recipes,please? Keep up the good work. I really liked how you took the time to address how to be aware of over fishing of our waters into consideration. Bravo."
lXU5Y0KVV2s,"Just saw it, of course I am subscribed to it for a long time, but ae you guys back in Kolkata ? Or still in SFO ? If you happen to come to NYC, just drop me a line. I will gladly welcome you guys"

lXU5Y0KVV2s,"I have been following bong eats for a long time now I am a senior lady doctor living in the United Kingdom for many years 
I just love Bengali food because I have grown up in a family of foodies and your channel is a fabulous find and a fabulous help to all young ppl  out there and lets face it we are there everywhere all over the world and we just miss our food 
I think bong eats is a huge huge blessing to all of us 
I enjoyed your video today and I'm looking forward to the one next Friday 
I have an antique Bengali cookbook and I will bring it to you when you guys move to Calcutta and start research on old recipes I'm really interested to see how that unfolds  in the meantime sending you my ashirbad and 
wish you both all the very best 
cuddles to bagha 
God bless"
lXU5Y0KVV2s,We are a big group of friends born and bred in Kolkata now living in Australia your videos are a blessing and most of your dishes centre of our gatherings. Love the way you focus on the method unlike others when the talk is more on them than the recipe. So keep doing what you’re doing you have made dreams and wishes come true. 👍
dv9P13Y6UZo,Lovely presentation! How do you steam rice on low heat without water for 20 mins?

dv9P13Y6UZo,Very nice presentation and music also nice.
dv9P13Y6UZo,Wow style of presentation is very nice.
dv9P13Y6UZo,"Fried rice is one of Kolkata's most common fast foods, that is CHINESE fried rice, not this delicate veg pulau which is a rare occurrence on the Bengali plate. No offence. Please make a video on the real *fried rice"" that most Bengalis eat, specifically in Kolkata. In the northeast, we use chicken and pork with soy and sesame sauce, and with green chillies and hoot jolokia (your choice) on the side."
dv9P13Y6UZo,What about slice carrot rather than dice carrot
dv9P13Y6UZo,Let’s just call it vegetable pulao. This is not fried rice by any stretch of imagination.
dv9P13Y6UZo,Can you tell me which brand basmati rice is best for fried rice?
dv9P13Y6UZo,I saw this video for the first time and ended up subscribing you ...😇
dv9P13Y6UZo,"They are calling it Fried Rice, but it goes by Bengali Veg Pulao, served with Thick Chicken curry or Egg curry. This is a very common fast food item available at almost all Bengali Snack shops. This is my Favorite, and lol, I just made it for the dinner and waiting to eat it in sometime. Egg Khosha with Bengali Veg Pulao."

tIIB_L9bBfU,What was that chatni u used at ur video............??
tIIB_L9bBfU,So shami kabab is basically sliders (mini burgers)?
tIIB_L9bBfU,Nice to know
tIIB_L9bBfU,"I have tried almost all your receipes and they all turned out good, however i face a lot of problem to achieve the measurements you show, we do not have any measuring instruments at home and you show the quantities in gms, if you could please show the amounts on the basis of tsp and tbsp and rest in pieces, it would be very helpful"
tIIB_L9bBfU,This is NOT a Shami Kebab. It’s something else entirely. It’s actually a mangsher boda. I’m surprised - given that your other recipes are perfect.
tIIB_L9bBfU,Why  raisins????
tIIB_L9bBfU,"I'm making this for four people.
Will you please mention the quantity of the indegrients?"
tIIB_L9bBfU,Yes I also do the same process
tIIB_L9bBfU,"Tried this recipe, taste was great but the texture became chewy and spongy. Can't understand where I went wrong, any suggestions??"
tIIB_L9bBfU,Food have no religion🙏🙏
tIIB_L9bBfU,But where did you use the egg you broke?
tIIB_L9bBfU,"I made this yesterday in iftar ,, it's really delicious . ❤️ plZ add some beef recipes"
tIIB_L9bBfU,Cloudy with a chance of shami kabab over the weekend! :P
tIIB_L9bBfU,Perfect recipe of beef shami kabab ❤️❤️
tIIB_L9bBfU,Thank you for sharing. I have made it 3 times already. I would like to share my experience with you. It's about the raisins. When I fry them even in low temperature the raisins burns before the kababs take brown color
tIIB_L9bBfU,Anyone who tried the same recipe?
tIIB_L9bBfU,Plz make a oven cooking playlist love your work

LI5dOCJgjpQ,"Blue Poppy is my aunt's restaurant :)
Thanks for the shoutout. Maashi ke bolbo about this video."
LI5dOCJgjpQ,tried this now and it was so so good! comfort in a bite <3
LI5dOCJgjpQ,Who found this after Deepika Padukone video
LI5dOCJgjpQ,They introduced it so many years back.. now after seeing Deepika’s interview other Youtuber’s are giving this recipe..
LI5dOCJgjpQ,Amazing dish... So simple... No spices... Yet so elegant
LI5dOCJgjpQ,I was just looking for authentic one in youtube after this dish got hyped up recently by deepika padukone.Here you are guys made it 6 years ago. You guys are best
LI5dOCJgjpQ,can I skip the White oil? will it take away the taste? please reply.
LI5dOCJgjpQ,Can you mention the cheese that yoh used apart from Blue Cheese?
LI5dOCJgjpQ,Ur channel is my addiction😢❤
LI5dOCJgjpQ,"Why didn't i ever had this !
Definitely gonna try"
LI5dOCJgjpQ,What cheese to use tho? If I can't use mozzarella? I had this in Bhutan every day and miss it!
LI5dOCJgjpQ,"I have a question.... Where do I can get some real / close to real  cheese in Kolkata...? New market? I have gone there once... I didn't see
Anyone.. Pls.. If u know, let me know pls.... Thank u"
LI5dOCJgjpQ,Hello I've been trying to get a copy of your cook book. Waterstones have been trying for about 6 weeks now without much success and have put in another order on my behalf. I just wondered if you could point me in the right direction of getting a copy please. Thanks
LI5dOCJgjpQ,"Soup? We call it 'tsoem' and the nearest translation to english is curry, though its definitely a curry. However we eat it as a curry with rice and sometimes -for those on a diet- with roti. However we never have it as a soup."
LI5dOCJgjpQ,"Much love from Bhutan 🇧🇹❤️
Loved how you made our signature dish so beautifully 🥰"
LI5dOCJgjpQ,I made it but I could not eat it because of the spice level.
LI5dOCJgjpQ,Datshi is incomplete without Bhutanese red chilli And datshi the local cheese ( Churpi in Bhutanese language) but you make not bad...
LI5dOCJgjpQ,Thank you so much for preserving our north eastern culture and sharing it through these recipes. Saw this recipe and Tingmo for the first time and just loved it. I am surely going to try these recipes at home and make it a habit of eating them more often as well
gGmCPwauVBs,I am a fan of your recipes
gGmCPwauVBs,"I never knew this existed and I am a Bong.  Amazing mixture.  It is not as rich as Garam Masala, and just the right zest in the food. Eliminating cinnamon and cloves is important.  Bengali cuisine is all about restraint.  Thank you!"
gGmCPwauVBs,Please share the Kolkata bhelpuri laal chatni recipe
gGmCPwauVBs,Why not add 2 sukno lonka in the mix ?
gGmCPwauVBs,Hi - why do you call it Bhaja Masala? It’s called Bhaja Moshla in Bengali. It’s like calling Macher Jhol “Macchi Jhol” 😊
gGmCPwauVBs,I have used the Bhaja Moshla in several veggie preparation to the absolute delight of all those who consumed.
gGmCPwauVBs,"Music, presentation, recipe all are superb.I was in search of authentic Bengali cuisine chanel since many years. Now my search has completed."
gGmCPwauVBs,Generally used red chilly also

5A-wXBJh6iI,beautiful message!! and nice recipe too. some Version add a spoon of poppy seed paste too ( postobata) in the mixture. do give that a try :) kalkei banabo paaturi. yummy
5A-wXBJh6iI,This is best recipe for Paturi. I always use this recipe when I crave for Paturi ❤
5A-wXBJh6iI,Bong eats is the Sabyasachi of food vlogs!
5A-wXBJh6iI,Watching your channel videos the way you are making the food gives an inner peace and brings peace of mind and happiness 😊
5A-wXBJh6iI,"I used to follow your recipes from lockdown times, each time it turned amazing. But this time I thought of following you measurements using scale, but very sorry to say that the measurement of water and salt was not correct. The paste became more salty and watery. This was the 1st time I exactly followed every measurements and got disappointed. But I must say for other days when I took only the ingredients for this same recipe with my measurements it was really good."
5A-wXBJh6iI,Is this sour yogurt or the sweet one?
5A-wXBJh6iI,I liked the awareness msg at starting point. Kudos
5A-wXBJh6iI,"Ones rokom maach pure duniya te khechi, kintu Ilish se kono jod neyi ❤… Ilish bachaon please 🙏🏼"

5A-wXBJh6iI,"11 th May is my birthday, on that i tried this recipe but a little change place of Ilish i took Rui fish😊 Every one like it soo much."
5A-wXBJh6iI,"HI, I am very interested by this recipe and would like to know whether I can cook it in the oven ? How long do you think it will take ?"
5A-wXBJh6iI,In all your videos you say that we should not buy Hilsa below 500 GMs because they are becoming extinct. but don’t you think you should follow the advice? It is more to impress. I loved your videos  until now. But i am disappointed that you do not practice what you preach.
5A-wXBJh6iI,I'm a half bengali and just loved eating this....but i ate the same food an many fish recipes in a trip to srilanka....a lot of tamil ppl in the eastern srilaka cooked fish similar to our way....and there were so many connections ( there were lots of kali maa mandhirs) there and many more....i just felt like being in kolatha  but only difference is those ppl spoke tamil...could anyone tell me if the tamils in srilanka has connections with our bengali ppl???....however i only felt it in eastern part in lanka....north was more like southindia and rest was sinhal food...which was very much different😊.....anyone who knows just lemme know
h5EloI7HDZc,bhog er khichuri hurls me down a lane laced with memories. the khichuri labra chutney and payesh would be in the same plate huddled in the warmth and love for each other and resulting in a unique  satisfying taste. that came alive with this and thank you so much for all that you create.
h5EloI7HDZc,I couldn't make the consistency in this way
h5EloI7HDZc,"Dearest Insiya and Saptarishi, can't thank you for this recipe. I followed the steps to the T and  the khichudinhas come out awesome. Don't have words to describe my happiness and content while cooking.


I'm a big fan of your channel and a few recipes I have tried are narkol bora, mach paturi, koraishutir kochudi  chitol maach er Muitha etc.

You guys rock. Whenever you're in Delhi NCR, kindly ping me. I'd live to host you two."
h5EloI7HDZc,Can u help with the measurement of water? Double the portion of rice and dal?
h5EloI7HDZc,I tried making khichuri by  watching this video... Everything is alright but the daal is not boiled properly... Can you suggest me that why this happened and what can i do for it
h5EloI7HDZc,Na mame bhog er khichuri r songe omlet..... mathai byamo ache naki tomader...oi byamo tuku chara  recipe gulo besh bhaloi

h5EloI7HDZc,Aaloo chop recipe please
h5EloI7HDZc,It turned out......😅 awesome 👍
h5EloI7HDZc,"I am in love with your channel, I stay away from home and your channel is the saviour whenever I crave for some home cooked bengali food, surprisingly more than calling my Mom. :D I am absolutely a die hard fan of Rannaghore K, hence an earnest request from a fan girl, if you guys can please collaborate with Ranveer Brar? It would be a treat watching that epic episode."
h5EloI7HDZc,How do you keep your utensils so clean? What’s the secret😂
h5EloI7HDZc,"Hi Saptarshi and Insiya🙂. I have been watching your videos for quite some time and take many crucial tips while making Bengali food. 

Recently I made Bhoger Labra by following your lead and it turned out to be very delicious👌. Thank you 😊.
I have a small question. Can we make this Khichuri in a pressure cooker. Whenever I try to make Khichuri in a pressure cooker, it dries up. If I put more water, then during the whistles, water flows out. Can you suggest something....
Thank you again for your videos 🙏💜"
MCBQ6UFUrP0,"I made this version of shukto, today morning and I have to say it was mighty impressive.  Loved the recipe.  I kinda oversalted the ""Lau"", whilst steaming, the only bummer here 😣 but the recipe is ""Oshadhoron"", rather ""Awe""-shadhoron""."
MCBQ6UFUrP0,Uchhe r mustard paste must in shukto
MCBQ6UFUrP0,Make a video on how to make dal'er bodi... ❤ ...love from Andaman
MCBQ6UFUrP0,This is not shukto. Without light  bitter taste sukto. My Maa prepare the same by adding nim pata.
MCBQ6UFUrP0,Uff how yummy and thanks for helping me become a better cook. While I have almost similar learning’s from my grandmother as she was from Chanpur and Faridpur  but as you know time takes away those learning . So grateful for helping me remember all those wonderful recipes. I did a little twist here. Followed all your process just added chalkumra too. It tasted just amazing
MCBQ6UFUrP0,"Warning: this recipe has wayyyyy too much salt! Bong Eats pinned another comment explaining why they suggest so much salt, semi-admitting that it’s too much and suggesting that we be conservative on the 10g salt for steaming. Anyway, I hadn’t read it before cooking so now I have alarmingly salty shukto. I’m really kicking myself for trusting the video more than my own judgment. Now I understand why this recipe can’t be found on their website either. 
In response to their rationale of “under salted gravy”, I disagree because the steaming juices carry plenty of salt into the jhol. Also, with only 25g milk, there’s really not that much jhol to justify 12g salt there either. So while in general I love Bong Eats recipes and recommend them to everyone, I wouldn’t make this one as written."
MCBQ6UFUrP0,What is the meaning of poppy paste m
MCBQ6UFUrP0,Thank you.❤
MCBQ6UFUrP0,❤❤ AAP BARI KAHA SE LETHE HO MERI BARI KARI RAH JAATI HAI HO SAKE TO ADDRESS DENA❤❤BAHUT SUNDAR LAU SHUKTO JITE RAHO BABU AAP TO AADHABHUT HO🙏🙏❤❤
MCBQ6UFUrP0,I don’t add maida I also use roasted fenugreek powder at the end when I garnish
MCBQ6UFUrP0,Can i steam the lau without adding salt?
MCBQ6UFUrP0,can we use mustard oil for frying and cooking this recipe?
MCBQ6UFUrP0,If u are trying sukto atleast have musterd seed and radhuni it's key ingredients
1UpCYhstIzo,Which flour you used?corn flour or maida?
1UpCYhstIzo,"I have made almost all the dishes presented by you guys. And each one of them has come out to be successful. Strange but even without spices,food can be tasty too. Keep growing bong eats. I really appreciate the efforts you guys put for all the recipies to be authentic."
1UpCYhstIzo,Just made this ... Omg so simple but delectable... Comfort food
1UpCYhstIzo,Place Change the music sometimes.
1UpCYhstIzo,"Which flour did.  U added at last....
Wheat flour or something else"
1UpCYhstIzo,"I love the recipes and demos on your channel and recommend it to relatives and friends who want to make Bengali dishes. But there's one thing that's very frustrating. Why do you give liquid measures in grams and not milliliters? And spice measures in grams rather than teaspoon and tablespoon? I know you have stated your reasons for this in a video, but really how many people weigh salt and turmeric and coriander powder or oil and water when cooking at home? 99% of us are going to ballpark the amounts unless they're given in a way that's easy to follow. Perhaps your list of ingredients could give measures in litres and tsp/tbsp for relevant items along with grams."
1UpCYhstIzo,Which flour it is?? Aatta Or Maida??
1UpCYhstIzo,Such an easy and quick dish
1UpCYhstIzo,Just tried this recipe moments ago and had two full plates of rice with it.. It was absolutely delicious. Bongs eats never fails me and Bengali food is my all time love... thank you so much for this recipe 🤗🤗🤗🤗❤️❤️❤️❤️
1UpCYhstIzo,"Few ingredients,simple  delicious recipes"
1UpCYhstIzo,A simple yet a great recipe
1UpCYhstIzo,"I tried it....And i love it!
It's easy peasy tasty man."
1UpCYhstIzo,The best thing about your channel is the absence of incessant chatter which is so soothing.And you make the entire process of cooking look so effortless.very neatly presented.I love your recipes. 👌👍🙏
1UpCYhstIzo,Background music is👌👌💃💃
kfjfXc3HhfY,Not perfect... You should learn first how to make this
kfjfXc3HhfY,Thanks... 👌🏻
kfjfXc3HhfY,Pro tip: please use onions which are paler pink or bordering over white. They give you a more golden colour
kfjfXc3HhfY,Apnader video r back ground song ta excellent👏👏
kfjfXc3HhfY,Can beresta be preserved for 4-5 days??
kfjfXc3HhfY,Super like for the sound 😍👍
kfjfXc3HhfY,Hi..How 2 store them...n 4 how long can they stay?
kfjfXc3HhfY,"Amar gulo kichhutei chharachhara hoyna. Kemon clump kore gelo. I used a flat bottom pan. Tel kom diyechhi oboshyo. Oi jonyo ki? Ashole tel er use minimal korar cheshta kori. 

Baki telta kono bhabe use kora jay?"
kfjfXc3HhfY,"I soak the onions in chilled milk to have a better colour & taste in beresta. Also, it makes the onion more Crispy."
kfjfXc3HhfY,I love all your recipes!! Perfect and explained so easily... Just a request... Can you please upload a recipe of chicken Biryani?
kfjfXc3HhfY,"I usually add a pinch of salt to the sliced onions and leave them for 15 mins. Once they sweat out excess moisture, I squeeze the water out and quickly dry them on a towel, and then fry them. They brown much faster and are also crispier."
kfjfXc3HhfY,You can add a pinch of sugar when it starts browning. It wud stay crisp     than normal fried onions.
kfjfXc3HhfY,Can you tell me for how long Birista can be stored in the fridge?
kfjfXc3HhfY,"Excellent not only the recipe, for the song. Audio visually excellent"

EZMuX05_eGU,"How I crave for this dal during summers !! Stopped having this when Mom isn't around.But I was searching for this authentic recipe. 
Thanks once again for reliving my childhood memories with this 'tetor dal'☺️☺️😍😍"
EZMuX05_eGU,Your channel had changed the mi date and broken stereotypes that people had about Bengali food. We have been hearing all our life that Bengalis only eat rice and fish. But you proved that wrong.
EZMuX05_eGU,"Amar priyo,perfect ranna hoyeche.😊"
EZMuX05_eGU,Your cooking reminds me of my mom ... love yr videos
EZMuX05_eGU,What about tumeric ?
EZMuX05_eGU,Darun darun...er theke amrito r kichu hoyna ♡♡♡
EZMuX05_eGU,Mid march to to mid april is the best time for this recipe. Try it its delicious.
EZMuX05_eGU,It's very nice
EZMuX05_eGU,Ei kodai ta ki induction compatible. Please please suggest where do I get same kodai in London..
EZMuX05_eGU,Lau is supposed to be boiled in dal. This way all the nutrients will remain intact. ☺
EZMuX05_eGU,"Oh god, this is my favourite."
EZMuX05_eGU,I crave for bengali foods and my search has stopped since I found your channel 😍thank you 😊
mOc1QdNHHEw,"This is quite similar to our pakhala of odisha.
I think this dish is inspired from the pakhala as well"
mOc1QdNHHEw,"Hello, it looks great. Do you use any of starter cultures to ferment the rice? I can't get, why does the fermentation happen? This rice has no the outer coating of the grain, just starch. Does the taste become slightly sour afterwards?"
mOc1QdNHHEw,My mouth is watering 😋  !!!
mOc1QdNHHEw,"Ooh ar parchhina
Ami ekhhuni khete chai.
Any way it's a month watering recipe.
Love you Insiya and Saptarshi ❤❤❤"
mOc1QdNHHEw,I love chanachur with panta bhaat🤭
mOc1QdNHHEw,"No those many item should not go  with pNtavat
Its not perfect too much addon"
mOc1QdNHHEw,This is not proper panta bhat without water never eat this rice that is most delicious part😢
mOc1QdNHHEw,Use me as a dislike button for this credit hogging bengalis
mOc1QdNHHEw,"We in Silchar eat panta bhat with dal er bora, kacha piyaj, kacha lonka, lebu , aloo bhorta with bhaja shukno lonka and the favourite shidol pura bhorta (roasted fermented fish)"
mOc1QdNHHEw,"In Tamil Nadu, we also have our own version of panta bhat, called pazhaya sadham. The same method of fermentation is used. D left over rice is soaked in water overnight. Farmers n workers generally consume it in d morning, d fermented water n rice is eaten with salt, green chilly n onion pieces. Also d water is added to buttermilk n consumed, while d rice is drained and lot of dal seasoning is added n eaten with variety of pickles, soevially with small sized tender mango pickle. My favourite method is adding til oil n salt to d rice and consuming with an array of fried sundried veggies, including turkey berry, black nightshade, bendi, gavar bean and lotus stem. A tamarind dish called vathakuzambu also setves as an ideal side dish.There are multitudinous ways of consuming pazhaya sadham or fermented rice in Tamil Nadu. Only a few are highlighted here."
mOc1QdNHHEw,Cool dark place as in a refrigerator?
mOc1QdNHHEw,Been cooking from your videos for 5 years now. Am a better cook. Thank you. 🙏🏽🌺
mOc1QdNHHEw,"God I love Panta bhaat. My whole family loves it. During summer ,it is best"
mOc1QdNHHEw,Being a bengali I have never had panta bhaat in my life because I don't like the idea of cold mushy rice.. but this presentation is making me wanna try it!!
F1vhnAPpJzY,"U r super amazing ..I get so much appreciation whenever I make anything with yr receipe , video , music , everything A+++....ma durga bless u ...keep posting more n more recipes ...we love it so much"
F1vhnAPpJzY,This is not at all the traditional way of Lau mug ghonto. It is unfortunate that someone with insufficient knowledge has released this video misguiding people
F1vhnAPpJzY,This is amazing ❤❤❤
F1vhnAPpJzY,Improvement tips - the music and video style does not sync. The music at times is way too junpy and video is super slow. The side ways panning of camera is a huge distraction
F1vhnAPpJzY,"This is more of a Chhechki than a ghonto !!
I cooked this following this recipe and the taste is delicious! 
Lau Ghonto in my family is cooked with of course Bhaja Bori but the Fodon is Methi ( Fenugreek), Green Chilli adding ginger paste right before turning the burner off. This is Bogura (Bangladesh) style. 

If you try this kindly share how did you find the taste. I can assure this unique taste will win hearts."
F1vhnAPpJzY,Although i m an Assamese...i m a big fan of bengali dishes..i have learnt to cook many bengali dishes after watching this channel...hope to learn many more
F1vhnAPpJzY,"Yes ,as children ,we have often been hoodwinked to eating things we often hated to eat by some other name,for it's nutritional value.i remember my parents  getting me to drink milk after dinner everyday saying that it would fetch me full marks in mathematics!"

channel gets more subs."
TKkzlsSpzEc,"Your kooking method of ""begun bhanja is not perfect because neither you said,which type of ""marshals"" used by you during begun bhanja nor explain about it."
TKkzlsSpzEc,Thank you
TKkzlsSpzEc,What should the flame/heat be?
TKkzlsSpzEc,"I don’t add chilli powder in begun bhaja, and I add sugar in the last , 3-4 mins before getting it out of oil."
TKkzlsSpzEc,what flour is this ? just normal wheat atta?
TKkzlsSpzEc,"I m going to try it just today, but one suggestion...the font should be of somewhat bigger size. I am a Punjabi, brought up in Kolkata,  I tried your Chholar Dal which was much appreciated by my Bengali friends."

TKkzlsSpzEc,The recipe is simple yet magical !
UkzICnqYMrY,Would have been nice to have an estimated time to cook...
UkzICnqYMrY,"Hello,planning to cook Govindobhog. Any special instructions?"
UkzICnqYMrY,"Another tip for the viewers: Soak the rice after washing, for 30 mins to 1 hour. 
Also, I boil the water first and then add the washed (and soaked) rice. It cooks faster 😊"
UkzICnqYMrY,"Could you please tell me, which is better between parboil rice and atap rice"
UkzICnqYMrY,Plz plz banglay bolben.. Onurodh roelo
UkzICnqYMrY,"@Bong eats
Hi. Is it common to boil and drain basmati or any rice in India?
When I first saw this technique somewhere on BBC, I thought it was something very wrong to do, coming from my East Asian background because we never cook rice that way.
But now I see this from your channel, which I like so much because it is coming from the people of Bengal and you try to be accurate with references, now I wish to know if this is something done commonly to cook rice in your region.
Thank you!"
UkzICnqYMrY,My I know the name of rice u used in this video?
UkzICnqYMrY,"Followed this recipe, rice came out like glue…. All sticky and gloopy. What did I do wrong?"
UkzICnqYMrY,"This is very different way of cooking rice from my country, South Korea, which is a bit annoying since we have to add the exact amount of water in the beginning and should never open the lid until it is done. I like this cause we can add howmuchever water we want. Thanks for the video!"
UkzICnqYMrY,"I came across your channel, I can cook everything but I can never cook perfect rice, this is going to help me a lot, Thank you❤️"
UkzICnqYMrY,"Though I was brought up in Bengal, one thing I could not ever develop a taste for is parboiled rice. I believe even as a small child I would develop diarrhoea. I could only tolerate raw rice like sona masuri cooked with extra water. As an adult I still don't like the pulao style rice in which the grains are separate. I consider it undercooked rice. So when newly married I used to make  rice separately for myself. We were only 2 people. But my husband liked fluffy rice with each grain separate. For my husband the rice to water ratio was 1: 2. For me it was 1:3. I slowly started to tolerate and eat rice the way most people and my hubby like it. This was cos I didn't want to cook rice 2 times. But eventually I came back to my way of doing things. I don't eat pulao at parties but only have the curd rice."
UkzICnqYMrY,I think this is posted for me
UkzICnqYMrY,"Boiling and discarding water actually strips the rice of most of its vitamins and minerals. Nutritionally not at all a good idea to do this. We want to eat healthy home cooked food, not restaurant style meal at home."
UkzICnqYMrY,Don't throw away the starchy water. It's good for plants. Highly recommended as a nutrient particularly for Curry Leaves plant. I put it in most of my indoor plants.
UkzICnqYMrY,What is parboiled rice?
UkzICnqYMrY,We got gobindbhogh rice and wanna know how to cook it so its not sticky.
i0Vs0hkuuVE,Pls share the recipeof this alur torkari and the keema stuffing
i0Vs0hkuuVE,3:45 and 3:49.   .....have different folding's.... don't get confused guys...instructions unclear
i0Vs0hkuuVE,"Being a Bengali and living in the US for well over 50 years your cooked meals look awesome. Unfortunately, I tend to avoid your recipes for the sole reason of your measuring techniques. It will be extremely helpful if your measurements of ingredients are in teaspoon/tablespoon units.  Do you have a simple conversion method for example, convert 5 gms.of salt to tsp?"
i0Vs0hkuuVE,"As usual, LOUD music makes this unwatchable.  Sad.  Ruined a good channel.  STOP HURTING MY EARS!!!"

wn3EUuW5S7s,Nice chopping
wn3EUuW5S7s,"I want to buy this knife , where should i get it?"
wn3EUuW5S7s,"You can also do that with a grater. Just do it with the section you use for slicing carrots-cucumber, the wavy one. For that you'll need to cut it 1/4 or 1/8 and hold every single portion to rub it against the slicer. Try it, it will definitely work <3"

Music is a great annoyance as usual.  Even though the music choice complements the food, it is inappropriate in a cooking channel and gives you a headache."

L5xXd2k-J9g,"I’ve recently moved to London, before which I lived in Bombay. Growing up in Kolkata, my grandmother used to make such recipes. I remember being drawn by the scent which would come from her kitchen, of mustard oil, kalo jeera (nigella seeds) and slit green chillies, a faint smell of caramelised sugar. This memory has been becoming such a core element of how I cook today and what my kitchen is. The kind of time and precision  invested in these videos by the channel is truly praiseworthy, and our gratitude to you is for taking such recipes (and memories) out in the world. Quintessential Bengali food is beyond biryani and China town’s Chinese, it’s what is brought down from those grandmothers cookbook. Today is a Sunday morning in London, I woke up Bong eats, mutton recipe, going to try it with the fresh lamb we purchased for lunch today. Please never stop this channel. It connects me to my roots ❤"
L5xXd2k-J9g,How do you cut coconut?
L5xXd2k-J9g,Made Narkoler boda with dessicated coconut  in England.  Lovely

plb-4p9V6U4,"No ingredients, nothing written. Not a channel for beginners"
plb-4p9V6U4,"I had forgotten some of the details, but as soon as I saw yours I recognised it as the classic Bengali recipe. There are variations with onions and ginger and garlic, and everything else; but this is what I had in my childhood."
plb-4p9V6U4,I'm a pure Bengali from Kolkata so I want say we eat musur daal without coriander and if we make it with coriander then we add tomato and Rai in tarka .
plb-4p9V6U4,I follow religiously Bong Eats ....it my go to wherever I am ...results -A1❤😊
plb-4p9V6U4,Thank you so much mam... ❤️😌
plb-4p9V6U4,"Hi, if one doesn’t have a pressure cooker. How long would it take for one to cook the dal ?"
plb-4p9V6U4,Huge fan of your recipes and the way you present them. Power to you!
plb-4p9V6U4,my girlfriend told me to learn this 😭
plb-4p9V6U4,Some things wrong with  your dal cooking learn more some things to do
plb-4p9V6U4,Thanks!
plb-4p9V6U4,"Except for the annoying music, your videos are excellent!  This Mushur Dal was always around in my Bangla bari in Kolkata, on Rashbehari Avenue.  My grandmother made it without the Tejpata, but with some fried onions.  Same red chili, kalo jeere.  Dhone patha is a nice touch.  I like to mix my Holud with some water, and pour it sizzling in to the fried onions and oil, to cook slightly before adding the dal. Less raw flavor to the holud.  This brings back memories.  We had little brass batis with some moori in it and some mushur dal on top as a snack when we were kids. All of us kids in the house would line up with our batis, like beggars and get this dal poured over the moori. So good!"
plb-4p9V6U4,The recipe is yum. The music is unbearable
plb-4p9V6U4,"With due respect, this won't taste authentic Bengali Moosurir dal."
plb-4p9V6U4,Our version of this daal is unique I think. We use as my grandmother used Radhuni as tempering and green chilli. I will definitely try this one . Thank you
plb-4p9V6U4,Made this today. It's -1 here. This turned out really good.
PJ5aQh_ILPo,No songs please. Instrumental ones are better.
