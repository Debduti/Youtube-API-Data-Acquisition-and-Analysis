5SY8pkuZIfk,Bong Eats,Palang Shaak Bhaja—Spinach stir fry with brinjal—Bengali vegetarian recipe,2024-02-23 04:00:01+00:00,"Palong shaak bhaja—Spinach and brinjal stir-fry

The winter markets of Bengal are full of the most vibrant array of vegetables. While spinach is eaten all year round in the West, here it is very much a winter guest. So it finds a prominent place in the shaak or the leafy-greens course on the Bengali lunch menu. This quick stir-fried version is made in our family with brinjals—another vegetable that is especially good in this season. We prefer to cook palong bhaja with younger, tender beginning-of-season spinach, reserving the more mature bunches, with thicker stalk, for palong shaaker ghonto.

👀 SPICY NEWS!!! 👀

urF2q-ylC18,Bong Eats,Cooking with Pritha Sen: Rannaghore Ke? Episode 9,2024-02-16 04:00:33+00:00,"Rannaghore Ke? is a fun adda with old and new friends about food, life and everything else. This is episode 9 with Pritha Sen.

We know Pritha di as someone who writes and talks about food and food history, but she contains multitudes, having worked in several—interconnected—fields over the course of her long and chequered career. A former teacher and journalist, Pritha di moved into the field of grassroots development work, working with artisans and crafts communities in remote areas to achieve sustainable livelihoods for them. 

As someone who has done a lot of reading, writing and research on the indigenous eating habits of the people of Bengal, particularly Undivided Bengal, Pritha di often takes that knowledge to her own food pop-ups and curated menus. Pritha di is also a chef consultant with fine-dining restaurants, which means she has curated menus and helped set up restaurants in Goa, Mumbai and Singapore.

Pritha di started sharing her family recipes when food groups were first popping up on the social internet. In the episode she talks both about the joy of sharing her personal food stories and recipes with a wider community for the first time, as well as the harsh judgement she faced against some of the ingredients she was using. So, today, when bloggers and YouTubers—like us—or even restaurant menus, feature dishes like maccher mathar chyachhra, macher teler bora, or khoshar chachchari of various kinds, we stand on the shoulders of the likes of Pritha di who has been, for more than a decade and a half, priming the audience at large to accept our indigenous eating habits, AND flaunt them proudly to the whole world.

Enjoy the recipes Pritha di cooks for us: khoi'er bora, Bikrampuri dal, lau'er khosha'r chhechki, and alu-phulkopi diye komola kaliya!",PT36M10S,hd,true,45408.0,1561.0,0.0,167.0,Friday,2170

kUnLPk_V8EI,Bong Eats,Niramish Mangsho—mutton curry for Bengali Kali puja,2023-11-03 11:22:55+00:00,"Niramish mangsho is a mutton dish that used to be cooked with sacrificial goat meat. Because this dish is offered to the Goddess Kali, it is cooked without any onion and garlic. This omission of onion and garlic is apparently enough to earn this dish the 'niramish', that is, vegetarian, tag in the eyes of Bengalis.

Niramish mangsho is in spirit similar to the Kashmiri rogan josh, which too uses only ground spices and no onion or garlic. Since this was traditionally cooked with the meat of goats that were sacrificed to Kali, it is best to use the meat of a small goat for this recipe. The larger, grain-fed, fattier 'rewaji' mutton is best reserved for dishes with onion and garlic.

Since this is a special dish for Kali Pujo, we have chosen to grind the spices from scratch. It can, however, be also made using readymade powdered spices.

The Bengali word 'niramish' is interesting because, unlike the English coinage 'non-vegetarian', niramish literally means 'non-meat'—ni (not) + amish (flesh). This makes 'amish' (or flesh) the default word, with the term for 'vegetarian' derived by pre-fixing 'not' to it.

🌾 We've served niramish mangsho today with fragrant Tulaipanji (siddha) rice from Amar Khamar.   🛒 Buy it online: https://go.bongeats.com/amar-khamar-free-shipping

zloZy7OFMQo,Bong Eats,Chaltar'r Tok with Jolpai—a special Bengali chutney with elephant apple,2023-10-26 04:00:36+00:00,"This particular chutney is my grandmother Durga's recipe. She made it on the day of Lokkhi pujo in late October/early November. It uses two fruits that are in season now–unripe chalta (elephant apple) and jolpai (Indian olive). This chutney is a good example of a unique kind of Bengali chutney that uses fragrant non-parboiled rice for flavour along with grated coconut for texture.

Chalta is a fruit indigenous to India and China with a very peculiar flavour and build. Its English name ""elephant apple"" apparently comes from the fact that elephants love chalta! Unripe chalta appears in the markets in Bengal beginning October, when they are used in sweet and sour chutneys, as well as for savoury preparations. Over the subsequent few months they ripen and become more fibrous and sweeter. They are then made into pickles!

🌾 The fragrant, small-grained Radhatilok rice used in this recipe is from Amar Khamar: https://go.bongeats.com/amar-khamar-free-shipping (apply code BONGEATS23 for free shipping on orders over Rs 750!)

11ZPGwN2pVE,Bong Eats,"Garur dal—a dal so seasonal, you can only make it for a week",2023-10-17 04:00:01+00:00,"Garur dal is a special dish cooked on the last day of the Bengali month of Ashwin, marking the end 
of the Sharat season, and the beginning of Hemanta. 

It uses summer vegetables that are about to go out of season, with some vegetables, such as water lily stalks, green tamarind, and water lily rhizome available during this period, and some winter vegetables that are just coming into season—a combination so unique that you cannot cook this outside this particular period of the year!

The vegetables required for this dish are all available together in the market for less than a week every year. That is why it took us 3 years to produce this video—the first year to learn my grandmother’s recipe, measure and test it (2021). We filmed it this time last year (2022) but there was not enough time to edit and release it in time for you to cook it. We are finally releasing it this year just in time for the last day of Ashwin, which is 18th October this year.

Cr_ARyKba2I,Bong Eats,Chhana'r Paturi—a complete guide—cottage cheese in leaf parcels—Bengali vegetarian recipe,2023-10-06 09:30:02+00:00,"Chhanar paturi's meteoric rise in Bengali feasts can be attributed to reasons similar to why the boneless bhetki fillet paturi became popular—it is easy to eat while standing at a buffet while maintaining polite conversations with people one vaguely knows. There is an element of joy in unwrapping a leaf parcel to reveal the content inside—but that is true for most paturi. The fact that chhana, i.e., cottage cheese, has become more popular than more traditional vegetables is probably because it is the least challenging, even to people unfamiliar to Bengali cuisine. All of this is of course our hunch and opinion.

Still, if we ignore the disproportionate fame it has garnered, chhanar paturi, the dish, is quite elegant and delicious. The most popular version uses the traditional paturi flavouring of mustard paste which we have included in the video for the sake of completeness, but it is our least favourite. The mustard's pungency overpowers the mild, milky flavours of the chhana (cottage cheese).

The other three, milder flavour variations play better with the star ingredient, chhana:
🥭 a green mango flavoured chhanar paturi that is based on a recipe from Anjan Chatterjee's 'Oh! Calcutta Cookbook'. 
🧀 one with the very traditional Bandel cheese, the smoked variant
🍋 and one with (somewhat cliche, but delish) gondhoraj lime.

The most important part here is the technique for making the chhana—taking care to curdle it at a lower temperature to produce soft curds, then mashing it by hand to produce a light airy texture. Then we make a base mixture with fresh coconut for flavour and texture, and hung curd for a little kick of acidity and richness. This base mixture is tasty on its own but you can play with it to add your flavours.

🌾 We've served our mildly-flavoured chhanar paturi today with the fragrant, buttery Chine Kamini rice from Amar Khamar. Visit https://go.bongeats.com/amar-khamar-free-shipping, or apply code BONGEATS23 for free shipping on orders over Rs 750!

Amra is a sour fruit that is very popular in Bengal. We are making a runny, thin chutney today, but you could easily make it thicker and more jam-like by using less water when pressure cooking the amra.

atAiM9I7eEY,Bong Eats,Calcutta Chicken Rezala—just like Mughlai restaurants,2023-09-15 05:13:28+00:00,"This is not a homestyle Calcutta rezala recipe. This is a no-holds-barred recipe—be it in the amount of oil or ghee, or the number of steps required. Our only goal was to make it as close to the restaurant-style rezala as possible. 

We have been looking for a reliable rezala recipe for a long time. All the recipes we tried from the internet or books produced a rezala that tasted delicious, no doubt, but they were not close to the rezala that is served in Mughlai restaurants in Calcutta. That style of rezala is watery thin, yet rich, flavourful, pearl-white rezala with good centimetre of oil floating on the top—the kind served in Mughlai restaurants in Calcutta, such as Sabir, Aminia, Shiraz, Royal, Arsalan and the likes.

So, just like the kochuri alur torkari recipe from 2018, for those of you that remember, we went about reverse-engineering the rezala recipe. 

The first step was to taste rezalas from all of our favourites. We tasted them side by side. Then sometime last year we came across this video by Mr. Nadim Amin, one of the owners of Aminia—sadly he passed away a few years ago, but you should definitely check out his channel. His video acted as the starting point for us. We cooked many, many batches, varying spices, cooking methods, using boiled onion vs raw, with and without poppy seeds, cashew, dry coconut—for several weeks all we were eating was rezala—until we arrived at this recipe which I think we are happy with. If you try it out, do tag us on Instagram.

This is episode 8 with Rahul Arora, who ran the Bon Appetit cafes in Kolkata, which had branches in Hazra and Salt Lake, successfully for 13 years. He now bakes, and cooks small batches of curated menus on weekends.

In this episode, Rahul talks about his childhood, and growing up in a Punjabi household in Kolkata. Rahul is himself not at all an orthodox cook. In his curated Punjabi menus, especially, he demonstrates how food can be rooted in tradition and family history, and still have room for personal, modern, practical touches.

Enjoy the recipes Rahul teaches us: desi murga curry (with country-chicken), and a khatti-meethi pumpkin sabzi, which he then turns into a raita and a pulao!

3jx4uvqLLdE,Bong Eats,Taaler kheer + Taaler luchi—traditional Bengali sweets using toddy palm fruit,2023-08-11 04:00:04+00:00,"Taal is the Bangla name for the toddy palm fruit. Ripe fruits appear in the market in the middle of August and stay on for just over a month. It is a fibrous fruit with a golden-yellow, sweet, fragrant pulp. The pulp is turned into all kinds of sweets in Bengal—fried sweet-savoury fritters (phuluri), taal-flavoured rice puddings, and various other stuffed sweetmeats. Today's video covers two of our favourites that are commonly served together—both made using taal pulp.

The first one is taal kheer—a pudding of the pulp with reduced milk and fresh coconut. The second recipe is luchi—a fried puffy bread that is kneaded with the pulp instead of water—resulting in golden luchi instead of the regular white luchis.

The taal tree is an important part of Bengal's natural landscape. It is a giant among giants—being the tallest tree in Bengal's flora of tall palms such as the coconut, date and betel palms. The tree is loved so much that it has had poems written for it by both of Bengal's greatest poets—Rabindranath and Nazrul. The love endures to this day.

D7ipEsZJfTE,Bong Eats,"Loitta machh'er jhuri—a dry, spicy Bombay Duck recipe from Bengal",2023-07-28 04:00:14+00:00,"Loitta, or lotey fish in Bengal, is known in western India as Bombay Duck or bombil. While loitta in its shutki (dried) form has a cult following, the fresh fish is also savoured for its unique flavour and soft, gelatinous texture. This particular preparation of loitta is very popular in our family. It is made in a variety of consistencies, ranging from a soft gravy (that we set aside for my father), all the way to a dried fudge-like paste (that almost everyone else in our family seems to prefer). If you are still at a stage where you are hesitant to eat shutki (the dried form), fresh loitta can be a very good entry point. 

It is also our duty to add that according to one theory, dried loitta used to be transported to Bengal (where it was more popular at the time) by the Bombay Mail, stinking up the post (letters, newspapers, etc.) on the train. The fish earned notoriety among the British as Bombay Daak (the Bangla word for ‘mail’). Hence, the name ‘Bombay duck’.

🌾 We've served loitta machher jhuri with plain dudhersar from Amar Khamar, although it'll probably taste even better with their red or hand-pounded dudhersar 👉🏾 https://go.bongeats.com/amar-khamar-free-shipping (use code BONGEATS23 for free shipping for orders over Rs 750).

livC-tGE93Y,Bong Eats,Shada Alur Tarkari—Bengali White Potato Curry | Quick potato curry recipe,2023-07-14 04:00:31+00:00,"If you have never had shada alur torkari before you may look at the recipe and think—boiled potatoes with a nigella-seed tempering—how good can it be? But make it once and you will be shocked at how delicious and comforting this incredibly simple dish tastes. It really lets the potato flavour shine like almost no recipe we can think of. Mashed potatoes are comforting, but they have a lot of butter and cream and salt and pepper. Potato soup has tonnes of other ingredients. Even alur dum and the spicy alur tarkari have other things going on. This has none. It is the purest homage to the Bengali love for potatoes.

51Pzl3VzHsU,Bong Eats,Lau Chingri—Lau Ghonto with Chingri—Bengali bottle gourd recipe with shrimp,2023-06-16 04:00:02+00:00,"On paper, lau chingri is a simple recipe with very few spices. In reality, it can be difficult to get right. Part of the problem is that bottle gourd (lau) can release a large quantity of water. The cook needs to use this water to cook the gourd such that by the time the gourd is perfectly cooked, all of the water has dried up. They must adjust the heat, and cover and uncover the pot based on how much water the gourd releases, and how fast it turns soft. This is a difficult thing to master as it is, but the problem is made worse by the fact that bottle gourds vary widely in water content and tenderness. Every lau is different!

On the day of filming we were lucky enough to find excellent lau in the market, the fine hairs on the surface still intact, AND some spotted kucho chingri (small freshwater prawns), which fishsellers refer to as harin chingri (deer prawns) because of the spots. 

🌾 We've served lau chingri today with a light mosur dal and 'Hand-pounded Dudhersar Rice' from Amar Khamar. It is truly gorgeous, flecks of red visible through white.

The potol turns soft and soaks up the creamy, nutty sauce. Potol (""parwal"") occupies an ambiguous place in our hearts. It is not our favourite vegetable. Yet, so many of Bengal's vegetable delicacies are made from it: deep-fried potol, potoler dorma, potol pur, tel potol, doi or doodh potol, kumror-potoler chhoka, and of course the ubiquitous potoler dalna, with or without prawns, and fish curries. We grind its peels into potent bata and bhorta. We even make sweets out of it. I am beginning to suspect that we actually love potol!

4. Temper the oil with dried red chillies and kaalo jeere. Add the potatoes. Fry for about 5 minutes. The potatoes should not brown, so keep stirring them regularly.
5. Add the poppy-seed paste, along with salt and sugar. Cook on low heat until the raw smell of poppy paste goes away. This should take about 4 minutes.
6. Continue cooking on low heat, with lid on until the potatoes are soft. Once in a while, when the pan dries out, you may have to add a splash of hot water to ensure the potatoes don't stick to the pan.
7. Finish with 2 slit green chillies and 1 tsp of mustard oil.

Sq7p2_KMlEA,Bong Eats,Aam Pana or Aam-Pora Sharbat + Charred mango margarita recipe—Bengali summer cooler,2023-05-12 04:00:22+00:00,"Aam Pana, also known as aam-pora sharbat is a charred green-mango cooler that is a life-saver during the excruciating summers of Bengal. Called ""aam panna"" in Hindi, variations of this drink are consumed all over South Asia. 

To make a really great aam pora sharbat, you must burn the mango until the skin burns to coal, and the flesh pulls away from the skin. The natural sugars in the unripe mango caramelise, turning the white flesh yellow. That is how you get a deeply smoky, rich aam pana. It is so smoky, in fact, that we skip the bhaja moshla (toasted cumin powder) that is commonly added to this drink. We find that it interferes with the smoky flavour of the charred mango. We did add some green chillies just when chilling the drink. These add a fresh top note, and provide just a hint of heat when you sip the drink.

The second drink, Aam-Pora Margarita, A.K.A. charred mango margarita, is our take on the classic margarita (although we are pretty sure lots of people have done this before). The sour element in the margarita is the charred mango pulp. This can be made with both blanco or reposado tequila, and would in fact be even better with mezcal. In this drink, we replace the black salt with regular salt because we find that the sulphurous smell of black salt does not go well with tequila. Plain salt produces a cleaner more crisp drink.

We serve the margarita up, but it can just as easily be served on ice to lengthen the drink. We hope you give these a try!

We cooked doi begun from all of our favourite Bengali cookbooks before we came up with this version. We have kept the sauce quite thin, but if you want a thicker gravy, you can add a little poppy-cashew paste. 

While you can cook this all year round, doi begun is best made in winter when brinjals are in season. We are particularly fond of the green thorny brinjals (kNata begun) which are indigenous to our region, but are increasingly becoming rare to find. Highly recommend looking for them in the markets if you are cooking this (or any brinjal recipe) in winter.

JrfPmWlKJ9o,Bong Eats,"Machh'er Jhal, shorshe posto diye—Bengali fish curry recipe with mustard & poppy",2023-04-07 04:00:10+00:00,"This simple machh’er jhaal (“jhaal” being the Bangla word for hot) sits somewhere between a jhol, which is a light thin curry, and a rosha or kaliya, which are more elaborate and heavy preparations. There are several variations of a jhaal—some use mustard, some don’t. Some use onions, some don’t. Even the tempering can vary depending on the fish. All of them are jhaal, i.e., hot—the heat coming either from mustard or chillies, or often both. 

This particular recipe comes from our neighbour and my mother’s good friend Aditi Bhowmik. It is easily one the top five fish curries I have tasted. This Poila Boishakh, get some fresh Rui or Katla from the market and give this recipe a try.

2. Set 1 L milk to boil in a saucepan along with split cardamom pods, sugar and salt. Reduce it on low heat to 30% of its original volume, about 30 to 40 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, in a second saucepan, heat another 1 L of milk. When it comes to a boil, turn off the heat and allow it to cool for 2 minutes. Add vinegar and cover for 10 minutes. When the milk has curdled, strain it over a fine-mesh strainer or a cheesecloth.
4. Once the milk in the first saucepan has properly thickened, and the chhana has been drained of all the excess whey, crumble the chhana into the thickened milk.
5. Add blanched pistachios and rose water. Cook until you see steam coming out (don't overcook the chhana at this stage or it will become dry and squeaky). Turn off the heat and transfer to a dish to cool.
6. Refrigerate for 6 hours, and serve chilled with a garnish of dried rose petals rehydrated in water.",PT44S,hd,false,35164.0,1505.0,0.0,16.0,Tuesday,44
Po_0CjhvY18,Bong Eats,Pressure-cooker mutton curry #shorts,2023-03-19 06:07:09+00:00,"🧄 INGREDIENTS 🧄

FOR THE MARINADE
1 kg mutton
10 g salt
5 g turmeric
80 g yoghurt
20 g mustard oil

FOR THE CURRY
250 g onions (sliced)
350 g potatoes (halved)
15 g garlic (ground to a paste)
30 g ginger paste
40 g tomato (chopped)
25 g mustard oil
4 dried red chillies
4 bay leaves
4 green cardamoms
1 black cardamom
1 cinnamon
5 g coriander powder
5 g red chilli powder
3 g kashmiri red chilli powder
12 g salt
10 g sugar
350 ml hot water
10 green chillies
1 whole head of garlic (unbroken and unpeeled)

🥘 METHOD 🥘
1. Marinate the mutton with salt, turmeric, yoghurt and mustard oil. Set aside.
Thinly slice the onions, peel and halve the potatoes, and roughly chop tomatoes.
2. Heat mustard oil in a pan. Temper with dried red chillies, bay leaves, green cardamom, black cardamom, and cinnamon.
3. Add onions and sweat on low heat, covered, for about 30 mins until they turn brown. For this curry we don't want to fry the onions, just mildly sweat them throughout, until they are soft and jam-like.
4. Add garlic paste and cook for 15 mins. Add ginger paste and cook another 15 mins on low heat.
5. Now add the tomatoes and salt. Once the tomatoes have softened a bit, add the powdered spices: coriander powder, red chilli powder and kashmiri red chilli.
6. Continue sautéing until the raw smell of the spices goes away (about 15 mins).
7. Add the marinated mutton. Turn the heat to medium. Add a whole head of garlic and halved potatoes.
8. Braise for about 20 mins until the mutton pieces are browned.
9. Transfer everything to a pressure cooker. Add 350 ml hot water and whole green chillies.
10. Cook on pressure until the mutton is tender. (For our model of pressure cooker, the one without a whistle, it takes 15 mins after full pressure is reached).
11. Turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release on its own.
Serve with hot rice.",PT59S,hd,false,26675.0,1313.0,0.0,10.0,Sunday,59
8bVM45eccsY,Bong Eats,Chhana'r payesh—quick and easy Bengali dessert with cottage cheese,2023-03-17 05:36:53+00:00,"Chhana'r payesh—a dessert made by first curdling milk, and then briefly cooking the resultant cottage cheese in more milk—is possibly the easiest among the myriads of payesh that Bengalis make. If you have all the ingredients, and you most likely do—it's just milk, sugar, and nuts—it only takes 40 minutes to cook from start to finish. Once chilled in the fridge, chhanar payesh is a crowd-pleasing dish for summer get-togethers, or to take to a potluck when you haven't got the time to make something elaborate.

♠️ A year later, we posted the recipe of 'pathar jhol' a slow-cooked mutton curry where the mutton is first browned with onions—not to the extent that we did for mutton kosha and with only 400g of onions—and finally simmered until the gravy thickens and the meat is tender—about 2 hours. 

♦️Today’s pressure cooker mutton curry is at the opposite end of the flavour spectrum in that we don’t want to brown either the onions or the meat too much. This keeps the flavours fresh and light. The sauce is runny because the quantity of onions is only 250g for every kilo of mutton and they completely melt in the gravy in the short pressure cooking time of 15 minutes.

gOvqZi4ya7s,Bong Eats,Pressure cooker mutton curry—♦️Holi Special♠️ | Bengali mutton curry recipe,2023-03-04 05:38:26+00:00,"This mutton curry is probably the most common style of mutton curry cooked in Bengali households. Early morning on Sundays and holidays, long lines appear in front of the neighbourhood mutton shops. Buyers fuss over the exact cuts and grumble about the rising cost of this delicacy. The quiet of the Sunday afternoons is punctuated by the whistling of pressure cookers, and the perfume of various mutton curries fills the narrow neighbourhood lanes. Didn't get mutton for Sunday? Not a big deal, but you are certain to regret it as the smell of your neighbour's mutton curry permeates your whole being.

GoNuJOfWblg,Bong Eats,Fish kababs you can make in an oven or on the stove! #shorts,2023-03-01 11:36:50+00:00,"🐠 INGREDIENTS 🐠
550 g pomfret
8 g ginger
8 g garlic
2 g white pepper
10 g salt
4 g kashmiri red chilli powder
2 g turmeric
4 g cumin powder
2 g jowan (carom seeds)
25 g hung yoghurt
20 g cream
1 egg yolk
10 g chhatu (roasted gram flour)
10 ml lime juice
1 tbsp chilli oil (infuse 2 tsp kashmiri red chilli powder in 5 tbsp lukewarm mustard oil, then strain)

🔥 METHOD 🔥
1. Make evenly spaced incisions across the body of the fish.
2. Prepare the marinade by mixing together ginger paste, garlic paste, crushed white pepper, salt, kashmiri red chilli powder, turmeric, cumin powder, lightly crushed jowan, yoghurt, cream, lime juice, egg yolk, chhatu and chilli oil.
3. Apply the marinade all over the fish, making sure to insert it into the incisions as well as the stomach cavity.
4. Arrange the fish in a dish or bowl. Place a small metallic bowl (or a makeshift bowl fashioned from aluminium foil) at the centre.
5. Burn a piece of charcoal over fire, and when it develops a layer of ash on the outside, place it inside the small bowl. Top it with ghee and cover immediately to allow the flavour of the charcoal to infuse through the fish.
6. After 15 minutes, remove the charcoal. Place the fish on a greased oven grill, and bake at 230°C for 5 minutes.
7. Take it out of the oven and brush with melted butter.
8. Flip the fish, apply melted butter to the second side as well, and bake again until done.",PT55S,hd,false,405775.0,18466.0,0.0,61.0,Wednesday,55

It is adapted from the legendary Jiggs Kalra's ""Prashad"" cookbook. 

The recipe is quite quick and easy, with a few optional steps that take can take it closer to that restaurant-taste. If you are short on time, you can skip those steps and still get a great tasting fish kabab that is perfect for making in large batches to entertain friends and family. 

We are cooking these fish tandoori in an oven, but they can also be made on a heavy skillet on the stovetop, or on an outdoor gas or charcoal grill. Do give this a try.

500 g radish
100 g potatoes 
15 g green peas 
15 g tomato
15 g grated coconut
4 green chillies
30 g mustard oil
1 dried red chilli
1 bay leaf
1 cardamom
1 cinnamon
1 clove
½ tsp cumin seeds
½ tsp cumin powder
¼ tsp turmeric
1 pinch red chilli powder
5 g ginger paste
8 g total salt (in two parts)
14 g sugar
¼ tsp atta
¼ tsp gorom moshla
1 tsp ghee
6 g coriander leaves 

⚙️ METHOD ⚙️
1. Peel and chop the radish into fine shreds. For 300 g of shredded radish, mix in 6 g salt. Set aside to allow the salt to draw moisture out from the radish.
2. Meanwhile, cut potatoes in 2-cm cubes, roughly chop tomatoes, shell peas, and slit the green chillies.
3. Heat mustard oil. Temper it with dried red chilli, bay leaf, cardamom, cinnamon, clove and cumin seeds.
4. Add potatoes and fry for 2 mins. Add grated coconut and fry until golden. Add tomatoes, and fry again for 2 mins.
5. Now add the powdered spices: cumin, turmeric and red chilli. Fry on low heat for 2 mins before adding in the ginger paste.
6. Add the peas and 2 green chillies, and sauté again another 2 mins.
7. Squeeze the water from the radish and add the shreds to the pan. From this point on, the heat remain low.
8. Slow-cook the radish, covered, in its own juices for 15 mins, then add in the sugar. Continue cooking another 15 mins.
9. Taste and adjust the salt. We ended up adding 2 g more (remember that we had marinated the radish with salt in the beginning).
10. Cook until the radish clumps together and the sugar caramelises slightly.
11. Mix in a little atta (flour) to allow the juices to coat the radish. Finish with green chillies, ghee, gorom moshla and chopped coriander leaves.",PT59S,hd,false,41415.0,1614.0,0.0,6.0,Monday,59

The recipe uses spices sparingly allowing the radish to shine. The red winter radish is available in the markets of Bengal all of winter and early spring, but it is between mid-November and mid-January that it is the most delicious. Mulo'r ghonto is not worth making with out-of-season radish in our opinion. Serve this with a plain rice and a light dal for lunch. Leftovers also go very well with rooti.

""Moog puli"", often known as ""bhaja puli"" (fried puli) or ""moog shamli"" is a type of ""pithe"" (pronounced ""pee-thay"") which is an umbrella term used to describe a variety of items prepared using rice, date-palm jaggery (only available in winter), coconut, milk, and flour. Pithe is no single dish, but a category of sweets that are part of the cooking tradition in many regions of India, dedicated exclusively to turning the season’s harvest into delectable foods.

Besides new rice, this recipe uses another winter delicacy—jaggery from the sap of the date palm. The making of choshi is a skill that requires practice. Watching experienced cooks deftly produce tiny rice-like dumplings from the serpentine rice-flour dough can be hypnotic. It really does feel like watching a magic trick where these dumplings keep appearing out of nowhere from under the palm of the cook.

We are, of course, nowhere nearly as skilled. Nevertheless, we have attempted to break down the steps in hope that it will be useful to those, like us, new to the art of choshi-making.

Machh'er tel consists of a good bit of fat, the swim bladder, and the liver—the intestines and the gall bladder are usually removed. Bengali cuisine has many recipes that make use of the fish innards or offals, but tel'er bora is definitely the quickest. You can serve this as a side with dal and rice, but we like them just with plain rice. It is fatty, it is crispy, it is truly decadent.

This recipe can only be made with absolutely fresh fish—best if the fish is live when you buy it. Large carps such as Rohu or Katla which are sold live in the markets are most appropriate. When cutting the belly of the fish open, take care not to puncture the gall bladder. If the gall bladder bursts, the pith will make all of the entrail bitter and inedible. If buying just the entrail separately, check that the fatty bit is pristine white (not yellow) and the bladder is intact. If the bladder has been removed, don't buy it. Most likely, it was removed because it had burst when cutting the fish open.

_zfLuo19g_E,Bong Eats,Orange-Pistachio and Poppy Seed Cake with Orange Drizzle—Easy Citrus Pound Cake Recipe,2022-12-29 04:00:07+00:00,"Orange cake with pistachios and poppy seeds are easy to make, and a perfect celebration of winter, when the markets fill up with all sorts of oranges and tangerines from Sikkim, Darjeeling, Punjab, Nagpur and even Malta.

To really drive in the flavour, in this cake we have taken a multi-pronged approach to orange-infusion. We have added a whole boiled orange, just as many Italian lemon cakes do, besides adding the zest of an orange to the cake batter. In addition, we have borrowed a technique from the world of bartending to make an _oleo saccharum_ with orange peels, which then goes into the orange syrup that is drizzled on top of the freshly baked cake while it is still hot. This is going to be the most ""orangey"" orange cake you have had.

This cake is based on the template of a 'pound' cake, meaning that it is not an extremely airy and light 'sponge' cake, but because we have used a tiny bit of baking powder and soda, and also some yoghurt, the cake turns out softer than a traditional pound cake.

8pf_CjOKe8I,Bong Eats,Pork Chop Sizzler with a Mushroom-Pepper Sauce: Inside the Trincas Kolkata Kitchen,2022-12-20 12:30:06+00:00,"Welcome to a new series on our channel, where we go behind the scenes at restaurants that fascinate us, to learn what goes into bringing us the lovely meals and happy times we enjoy when we eat out. This is the fourth and final episode, featuring Trincas Kolkata's signature sizzling pork chops in a mushroom-pepper sauce.

This video includes a recipe of the brown stock that forms the base of many dishes on the continental menu. In this dish, it will be used to make the mushroom pepper sauce that goes with the pork chop.

**This recipe is a good example of Calcutta-style continental cooking— continent here presumably referring to Europe. The cooking is very unorthodox. It uses lots of local flavours and cooking-styles, and plenty of spices in European inspired recipes.** 

The ingredients reflect the various communities that have lived together in Calcutta. That is how you end up with Chinese oyster sauce and British Worcestershire sauce in the same marinade.

This series is not sponsored by Trincas but was made possible with the support of their incredible staff. Special thanks also to Willie Walter's Quartet for the music, recorded live at Trincas on 11 December 2021.

bs3Zan_ASzQ,Bong Eats,Mangsher ghugni | Mutton ghugni | Pnathar ghugni—Bengali ghugni recipe,2022-09-23 04:00:30+00:00,"How do you improve upon the perfection that is ghugni? Have you tried adding a goat to it? Bengalis have, and it works splendidly well. Mangsher ghugni also known as pnatha’r ghugni or khasir ghugni (pnatha and khasi are both names for different types of goat) is a hot favourite snack—especially for Bijoya guests.

While we like the regular ghugni made with matar (dried yellow field peas), for mangsher ghugni we prefer kabuli chhola (aka garbanzo aka chickpea) for its meaty flavour, and for just how well it soaks up the good mutton fat and juices. No wonder chickpeas and goatmeat are a classic combination in cuisines all over the world!

Mangsher ghugni can be eaten on its own with a squeeze of lime, some chopped onions, green chillies, a sprinkling of bhaja moshla—mopped up with a toasted bread. It can also be eaten with luchi or porota for breakfast or dinner.

Our version is quite light, perfect for eating by the bowlful.

4LrPkp66Ly0,Bong Eats,Chhana'r Kofta Curry—Chhanar Borar Dalna—Bengali Paneer Kofta Recipe,2022-09-16 05:46:50+00:00,"Chhanar Koptakari (kofta curry) is our favourite from the vast repertoire of chhana or paneer-based recipes in the Bengali cuisine. Unlike the regular chhanar/paneer dalna, the chhanar borar dalna requires a bit more work in forming and frying the koftas, and then making the curry. The browning of the koftas also creates a far more interesting texture and flavour contrast compared to plain chhana/paneer. It takes a little over an hour to make this, but you will be rewarded with juicy sponges soaked with the ginger-cumin-ghee flavoured curry. Since this dish is quite rich, pair this with a sparingly spiced dal (such as Bengali masoor dal with radhuni tempering). It can also compliment a light Bengali-style fried rice (recipe link below).

YLyc_TUj_TY,Bong Eats,6 Steps to a Perfect Chicken Pakora (and the secret to making them extra crispy),2022-09-09 05:17:09+00:00,"Chicken pakoras are loved all over South Asia in various forms as a snack or as an accompaniment to a meal. Our intention with this video was to not only create a reliable recipe for the kind of chicken pakora we like, but to also put together a general framework for chicken pakora that you can adapt to your liking. With that idea in mind, we split up the recipe into six steps that should help you decide what choices to make to produce the type of pakora that you are trying to make on a given day.

We have also included tips for cooking them in batches and putting them away for a rainy day.

jfqCZ0l0m4w,Bong Eats,🦀Kakrar Jhal—a spicy Bengali crab curry recipe + easy live crab-cleaning steps for beginners,2022-07-29 04:00:19+00:00,"Kakrar jhal is a light yet fiery crab curry common in many Bengali (and indeed eastern Indian) households. This recipe is exactly how my paternal grandmother cooked crabs, with one interesting twist of our own—which is that we sometimes add a little mustard paste towards the end. The extra pungency really adds to the ""jhal"" (heat) 🌶🦀🌶

The video also includes a detailed step-by-step process of cleaning a live crabs that is safe and relatively easy for beginners, who may not be confident handling live crabs. Putting crabs in the freezer at temperatures under 4ºC puts them in a state of torpor, and makes them less likely to feel pain. It also reduces their mobility for easier handling. Then they are briefly put into boiling water, which kills them instantly.

In Bengali homes it is usually made from Rui/Katla (i.e., carps), but in restaurants and cabins it is commonly made with trimmings of Bhetki fish fillets (that get turned into fish fry). We are using Aar, which is a type of large cat fish because it is fattier and more delicious and has fewer bones.

It is usually served with a cabin salad (cucumber, onions, beetroot, carrot) and kasundi (the Bengali fermented mustard condiment).

Thor is the innermost core of the banana stem. It develops only after the banana plant bears fruit. It has a crunchy, spongy, and fibrous texture which is a perfect vehicle for any flavour you put in it, as well as to add texture to dishes (such as labrar torkari). Thor’er ghonto is perhaps the most celebrated dish made out of the banana plant stem. The recipe is simple enough. The only cumbersome part of cooking this dish is prepping the thor, where one needs to remove the stringy fibres between slicing the damned thing.

Zk88kKYg7iA,Bong Eats,Beler shorbot—bael sharbat or bael panna recipe,2022-06-17 13:00:20+00:00,"Bael a.k.a. the “Bengal quince” is an underrated fruit. Calling a fruit so exquisite “wood apple” was a criminal branding mistake! It is also a pity that bael ripens in summer, when all anyone wants to know is if the mangoes are properly good yet. So, in April, when the bazars are full of ripe bael, and mangoes are nowhere near ripe, we sip on our bael sharbat, paying scant attention to the deliciousness of the fruit at hand, and pine for the mangoes. 🤷🏾‍♂️

One hardly needs a recipe for a bael sharbat/bael panna, but may be this video will entice you to eat more bael at home? Just make some bael pulp and keep it in an airtight container in the fridge. It will keep for 10 days. Bael sharbat makes for a great breakfast smoothie. Or when you come home from the heat, make yourself a glass of cool bael sharbat. It is quick, nutritious, and refreshing.

She had limited means, but she would teach herself things to cook that she had only heard of, or seen from a distance, using her instincts, and experimentation. Her doi bora was one of her most prized recipes—they were soft and airy and did not have the dreaded hard lump at the centre. My mother learned it from her, and we learned it from my mother.

Do not miss the sweet tamarind chutney. It really is the dark horse here! Keep it in a jar in the fridge to drizzle on all kinds of chaat.

Besides the regular sweet and sour doi bora, we have included another one of our favourites—the salty-sour “dahi vada” that Saravana Bhavan used to serve when I worked in Chennai. If you have eaten it, you already know how fabulous it is. If you have not, please give that variation a try.

v1FAq9bla4A,Bong Eats,"Chilli Fish Recipe: Inside Trincas, Kolkata's Kitchen",2022-05-27 13:00:30+00:00,"Welcome to a new series on our channel, where we go behind the scenes at restaurants that fascinate us, to learn what goes into bringing us the lovely meals and happy times we enjoy when we eat out. This is the part II, featuring chilli fish, from Ming Room, Trincas Kolkata's Chinese dining room, which opened its doors to the public in 1982.

In this video, the Trincas chefs take us through the process of slicing fresh bhetki fillets to produce even pieces of fish; preparing one of the most crucial components in all Chinese cooking, the stock; prepping the vegetables for even cooking and texture; and finally, frying the fish and finishing it in sauce for a customer order. 

This episode is not sponsored by Trincas but was made possible with the support of their incredible staff. Special thanks also to Willie Walter's Quartet for the music, recorded live at Trincas on 11 December 2021.

59oqlvbE1Ws,Bong Eats,Phool Chingrir Bora—Tiny shrimp fritters—Bengali fried snack recipe,2022-04-14 13:00:06+00:00,"Phool chingri, a smaller version of kucho chingri, is a variety of tiny river shrimp that is caught in the distributaries near the Sundarban delta in bengal. These small shrimp have very soft shells and an intense shrimpy flavour that you simply cannot find in larger shrimp. They are either sold fresh in the markets or are made into shutki—dried fish—and are considered a delicacy in Bengali cuisine.

Phool chingri'r bora (tiny shrimp fritters) are perfect with rice and a light dal. They can also be an excellent snack with a glass of beer! If you find them in the market, do not miss picking them up.

24jPw2-N22c,Bong Eats,Muri Ghonto Chal Diye—Bengali delicacy of fish head cooked with rice,2022-04-08 15:17:26+00:00,"Muri ghonto can refer to a large number of dishes that use fish head and another main ingredient (such as dal, or potatoes, or cauliflower). This particular variation is the one with rice.

Any culture that truly loves fish holds the fish head in great esteem. There are hundreds of different ways in which Bengali cuisine uses fish head—sometimes as a way to flavour other ingredients such as vegetables or dal, but also, often the head *is* the star of the show. The muri ghonto is such a dish. The fragrant rice here almost seems to be a receptacle for the fatty goodness that is rendered out from the fresh carp head. 

Make muri ghonto as the main for your next gathering instead of the same old basanti polao.

However, we do make arahar dal quite often, if only to take a break from our everyday mosur, moog, and biulir (urad) dals. This version of arahar dal is fairly mild, best eaten with rice and a squeeze of lime, and, in this instance, some fried phool chingrir bora (fritters made from tiny shrimps: recipe coming soon!).

This quick chicken curry makes good use of the bounty of flavourful winter vegetables that are all over the markets in Bengal now—new potatoes, sweet red carrots, sweet peas from Ranchi, green tomatoes, tender beans, purple turnips. With produce that good it is no wonder that this requires no great technique or effort. Everything happens in a pressure cooker (or even a pot if you don't have a pressure cooker)!

Do give this one a try while we still have a few days of winter left.

iI4Yy0Xs_V8,Bong Eats,Doodh puli pitha recipe with patali gur—Bengali sweet rice dumplings with coconut and date jaggery,2022-01-08 13:16:50+00:00,"'Puli' refers to a whole range of stuffed (usually) sweets encased in rice or lentil flour wrappers. Puli is a type of 'pithe', which is an umbrella term used to describe a variety of sweets (and some savouries) prepared during Poush Sankranti, the rice-harvest festival in Bengal, using rice, date palm syrup (patali gur), coconut, milk, and flour.

Puli pithe can be fried, steamed, or boiled in milk. This recipe for doodh puli refers to puli boiled in milk ('doodh'). It uses two seasonal ingredient—newly harvested rice and patali gur (date palm jaggery) that is only produced in winter in Bengal.

Making puli is pretty straightforward. The only issue is that if the rice flour is not adequately cooked before forming the dumplings, the pulis turn out chewy and hard. The fix is to use sufficient quantity of water, and to cook the dough for long enough.

Shaping is more difficult than with wheat flour dumplings, since the rice flour dough is not as elastic and tends to break easily. So, we have gone with a very simple spindle shape. If you would like to look at just how beautiful puli folding can be, watch this video from @banglarrannaghor  ▶️ https://youtu.be/ITqZaQajqiU

1ycH8R5wylI,Bong Eats,Perfect caramel custard recipe | Flan recipe | Crème caramel,2021-12-10 07:23:40+00:00,"What is the difference between crème caramel, flan and caramel custard? For the most part they are all the same. The French call it crème caramel. Much of the Spanish-speaking world calls it flan. In India, this dessert is popular as caramel custard. 

This simple dessert is perhaps one of the best examples of the alchemy of eggs—the magic that allow the egg proteins to harden and form the delicate, silky, creamy blob of deliciousness that is this custard.

There are thousands of great recipes for flan on the internet. Ours is based on the fantastic recipe on Serious Eats by Sohla El-Wallyly (link below). In fact this dessert is so forgiving that even if you do not follow the exact measurements you will most likely end up with something tasty. However, while making a crème caramel is easy enough, making a perfect crème caramel certainly requires practice, as well as a deeper understanding of how a custard sets. We have some tips below that should help. We also recommend watching this very comprehensive video on the correct way to cook a custard by a channel called Magic Ingredients (link below).

HKNdt5ePjjw,Bong Eats,Bhuna Khichuri Recipe—A very special niramish dry khichuri for Lokkhi pujo,2021-10-18 14:04:37+00:00,"Bhuna khichuri is possibly thamma's (my grandmother Durga) most acclaimed recipes, even more than the labra'r torkari this bhuna khichuri was served with. This was made once a year on the day of Lokkhi pujo to offer to the goddess of prosperity. Thamma always made two kinds of khichuri on Lokkhi pujo—this one, as well as the runnier, less decadent version. Bhuna khichuri, at least thamma's version that we have grown up eating, is in may ways more opulent than a polao, and shares many qualities with a good polao. The grains of rice and dal should be unbroken, fully cooked, but each grain should be separate. They should glisten with ghee and be lightly spiced. Naturally, she used a lot of ghee—about one and a half times more than her mishti polao even. For me and my cousins, (and lots of relatives and friends in the neighbours) thamma's bhuna khichuri was one of the highlights of the year. It is a recipe very close to my heart.

KILjD3Z6ufs,Bong Eats,Chitol Machher Muithya—Bengali Chitol Fish Dumplings,2021-10-13 08:43:11+00:00,"Chitol (Indian featherback) is a prized fish in Bengal and Assam. Chitol machh'er muithya is essentially a dumpling made from the flesh scraped out of the extremely bony dorsal side (called ""gaada"" in Bengali) of the fish. Chitol'er muithya has a very meat-like, springy, squeaky texture—almost like a good German wurst. This is very much a Bangal (East Bengali immigrants to India) delicacy made on special occasions.

The preparation requires some patience, but it is not technically difficult. If you practice scraping the flesh out of the gaada once, you will get a sense of how the bones are laid out, and how to gently get the meat out without upsetting the layout of the bones. If you scrape indiscriminately, or apply too much pressure in the beginning, the bones will go in every direction, making it very difficult to separate the bones out later from the mince. In short, it really is not as hard as it looks. Just takes a bit of time.

We hope you give this a try.

Bjq2EYOrXlc,Bong Eats,Lau Pataye Chingri Paturi—feat @SayatyaandFriends—Bengali recipe of prawns steamed in leaf parcels,2021-09-24 15:01:02+00:00,"Lau Pataye Chingri Bhaape or paturi recipe: Today, we are looking back at the first recipe we ever filmed and uploaded to this channel—chingri bhaape, where prawns are steamed in a pungent mustard sauce. In that video we had used a microwave to steam the bhaape.

This time, as part of our collaboration with @SayatyaandFriends we decided to recreate our older chingri bhaape video. We have modified the proportion of ingredients, plus, this time we are showing you three common ways of making any Bhaape or Bhaatey in Bengali cooking. 

Now, the prawns, or whatever is being steamed, can be placed either in a metal container, or in a leaf parcel. Gourd leaf (lau pata) is the best option, since just like banana leaf it imparts its flavour to the dish, but unlike a banana leaf the steamed gourd leaf can be eaten along with the dish!

Irrespective of whether you use a leaf parcel or a metal container you can use now use one of three methods to steam:
(1) When you make rice place the parcel or container in the rice either when it is nearly done cooking or just after it is cooked an the starch water has been drained. Which method you use depends on your quantity of rice and what ingredient you are making Bhaape with. If you are not cooking rice for a large family, it is best to put in the container in the last 12–15 minutes of the rice cooking. This is because for small quantities of rice, the residual heat in the rice may not be enough to fully cook your Bhaape.

(2) The second method is to submerge the container partially in water, then cover tightly with a lid and cook.

(3) The third method is, of course, to use a dedicated steamer where the water never directly comes in contact with your dish.
All of these three methods are superior to the microwave method because the dish cooks more gently at a lower temperature, and chances of overcooking are low. Having said that, microwaving is a perfectly acceptable method once you figure out the correct power and timing for your particular model of microwave and a given quantity of ingredients.

K37GpmFcplE,Bong Eats,Notey shaak—Green Amaranth | Bengali leafy greens recipe,2021-09-18 04:48:52+00:00,"নটে শাক (Notey shaak) is the leafy greens of green amaranth. Notey is usually eaten in Bengal during the warmer months. The red variant of this plant is known as লাল নটে (Laal notey) or simply লাল শাক (Laal shaak) not to be confused with a similarly red-leafed (ঢুলা শাক) Dhula shaak. 

There are two minor variations to the notey shaak recipe that are made in our family. The first one is niramish (meaning vegetarian with no onion or garlic) and adds fried bori and peanuts. The second one uses a tiny bit of garlic to flavour the oil and skips the garnishes. Both very simple to make, the only part that takes a bit of time is cleaning and picking through the leaves. We hope you give this a try.

KEFoA6p1FjY,Bong Eats,"Machher jhol recipe—potol, jhinge, alu diye jeere ada bata jhol—Rohu fish curry with summer veggies",2021-08-27 05:25:47+00:00,"Machher jhol (Bengali fish curry) can refer to scores of different recipes. It is essentially fish cooked in some kind of a sauce. This particular variation of machh'er jhol—the jeere, ada bata, shobji diye machh'er jhol, fish curry with cumin, ginger, and veggies—is the most frequently made variant in our household. It is the default machher jhol.

This being the summer version, it has all the usual suspects—potol (pointed gourd), jhinge (ridged gourd), alu (potato)—and you can add any other summer vegetable that you like which won't turn to mush when cooked. 

The fish, a medium sized (~2 kg, whole) rui (rohu) in our case, can be substituted with any small or large freshwater live or fresh fish—katla, mrigel, bata, and even tilapia.

It would be hard to find a more comforting, nutritious fish recipe for the hot weather. Most of you probably don't need a recipe to cook this dish, but no document on Bengali food would be complete without this recipe. So, here it is.

Du6Bsj2s47Y,Bong Eats,Shutki machh bata—Bengali hot-garlicy dried fish recipe,2021-07-10 14:48:13+00:00,"Shutki, or dried, cured fish, can be a polarising subject among Bengalis. To generalise, people from East Bengal (present day Bangladesh) love shutki in all its stinky glory, while people from West Bengal find the very idea repulsive. In a modern world where more and more people are discovering the nuances of smelly fermented, cured, food—blue cheese, stinky tofu, lutefisk, kimchi, axone—perhaps it is time to revisit our own past and give shutki a chance.

This dish, hot and loaded with garlic, is a very accessible gateway into the delicious world of dried fish and meat. We hope you give it a try.

There is a whole category of recipes in Bengali that are called ""pothyo"" (পথ্য), meaning food for patients to go alongside medicine. Singi machh, or indeed all jiol fish fish are highly nutritious and are often traditionally prescribed for convalescing patients.

Shingi machh (শিঙি বা শিং মাছ) is a type of jiol machh (জিওল মাছ)— fish that can stay alive outside water for a long period of time because they have a lung-like secondary respiratory organ. They are always sold live. Magoor (মাগুর), shol (শোল), taki (টাকি), koi (কই), etc., too fall under this category. 

This recipe is best made with any jiol fish, but can be made with any live freshwater such as chara pona, shor puti, tilapia, etc. too. A version of this recipe is also known as kabiraji jhol, where the chillies are replaced with black pepper or long peppers. We will make a separate video on kabiraji jhol later.

mmKtCPKduJM,Bong Eats,Paat Shaak Bhaja—stir-fried jute leaf—Bengali vegetarian recipe for summer,2021-06-12 14:54:25+00:00,"Shaak, meaning, leafy greens is the second course of a Bengali lunch meal (the first being teto, meaning bitters). Paat shaak is stir-fried jute leaves. The texture of jute leaves is a combination of slightly slimy and fibrous (kind of like mustard greens). This particular family recipe includes ripe pumpkin and potatoes for texture, but several other variations exist.
It is usually served with kashundi which is a Bengali fermented condiment, usually containing mustard.
Jute is a crop native to the Gangetic delta. Its importance in the Bengali culture and economy increased with the setting up of jute mills in the 1800s. These mills produce the yarn that is woven into gunny sacs or burlap. Even today 80% of the world's jute is cultivated in the Gangetic delta.

6F5PaAvBbOg,Bong Eats,Potoler dorma—two versions | Bengali stuffed pointed gourd recipe,2021-05-28 05:35:01+00:00,"Potoler dorma: The Bengali dorma is said to be a local evolution of the Middle Eastern dolma, which is part of the Ottoman cuisine. Dolma was possibly brought into Bengal by Armenian immigrants. If you are interested in the fascinating history of the Bengali dorma, you can read Tanushree Bhowmik's well-researched post here: 
🔗 https://go.bongeats.com/dorma

Dorma can be made with a variety of vegetables, although the one made with potol or pointed gourd has become most popular among Bengalis. The stuffing can vary widely and traditionally includes dried fruits (and sometimes nuts). We have a niramish (without onion or garlic) version here that uses ground Bengal gram, and an aamish (non-vegetarian) version with fish and prawns. Non-vegetarian stuffing can include dried fish (shutki) or meat, while vegetarian fillings can be made with chhana (cottage cheese), rice, or other vegetables.

FBnKYbUNhYc,Bong Eats,Echorer dalna/Kathal er tarkari—Bengali jackfruit curry,2021-04-30 09:53:16+00:00,"Echor (pronounced ""ey-chore"") is unripe kathal or jackfruit in Bengali. It is a meaty vegetable that, after mangoes, is easily the best thing about summers for us. No wonder echor is referred to as গাছ পাঁঠা (gachh patha, meaning tree goat—that is mutton that grows on a tree) in Bengali. 

This echorer dalna recipe shows two variants — one niramish (that is vegetarian and with no onion or garlic) and another that is flavoured with chingri, i.e. small shrimps. We like to have this with a tok dal with green mangoes and rice. If you have never tried echor, we highly recommend giving this a try. The cutting and cleaning takes a little bit of patience, but it is not as difficult as it looks—and the end results are more than worth the toil.

oMA8gjEfu5g,Bong Eats,Easy Neem Jhol—simple Bengali vegetarian dish for hot summers,2021-04-16 05:12:36+00:00,"Neem jhol is a tito (bitter) that is served at the beginning of a Bengali lunch. This is especially made in spring and beginning of summer with tender brown new neem leaves, and tender drumsticks (shojne) that become available in the markets at this time.

The neem jhol shown in this video is a very light version that is made in our family when the weather is turns hot. It is light and satisfying. This recipe only uses neem leaves, drumsticks, potatoes and sweet potatoes, and almost no ground spices apart from turmeric. However, there are more elaborate versions of neem jhol that use more ground spices, ginger, etc., and a tempering of either panch phoron or methi + mustard. Additionally, neem jhol can include a lot of other summer vegetables such as green bananas, green papaya, brinjal, and if you are making this in the beginning of spring, sheem (broad beans) too.

This is best enjoyed with a small quantity of rice in the beginning of a meal for lunch.

Rxg8Qu6eE8o,Bong Eats,Shora pithe or chitoi pithe recipe—Sankranti special Bengali rice dumplings,2021-01-25 16:16:33+00:00,"Shora pitha, also known as, chitoi pithe is a rustic rice dumpling that is made in winter, especially around the time of Sankranti—the winter harvest festival. In our family, my thamma Durga made  shora pithe only once (or twice) a year on the coldest January afternoon. It was one of those rare occasions when the clay oven was lit. The shora—which is the round terracotta mould in which this pithe is made—was taken out and cleaned. We sat around in the heat of the clay unoon watching thamma pour ladles of rice batter into the mould as the mound of rice dumplings grew tall. Finally, we dunked the smoky shora pithe in jhola gur—liquid date-palm jaggery that is only available in winter—and devoured them by the dozens until our stomachs hurt. 

The ritual and fanfare of making the pithe are at least half the fun of eating these.

KeOqS0CAeZ4,Bong Eats,Singara recipe + sweet chutney with secret tips and tricks—Bengali mishti'r dokan-style singara,2020-11-27 03:30:01+00:00,"Bengali singara recipe + bonus with sweet chutney that singara is usually served with: A couple of years back we had made a phulkopir singara video. This recipe uses a plain potato filling instead. Plus, this includes several modifications to the crust/pastry that we have been working on in the last two years. So, you could think of this as the singara pastry version 2.0

We also realised that there are no reliable videos on YouTube for the sweet Bengali sweet chutney that is served with the singara in Calcutta. So, we decided to reverse-engineer one of our favourites—good old Ganguram. The chutney is both sweet and hot, and it gets its unique flavour from the spices used as well as the sugarcane jaggery. We think you are going to like it.

We are thankful to JK Spices for supporting our channel. We use products from JK Spices all the time both because of their quality and the fact that they are a local brand based in Calcutta. So, this collaboration was a natural fit. You can order their products online at https://jkcart.com/ and they deliver all over India.

36Ax1_XH-B4,Bong Eats,What camera do we use? Food video camera setup and gear recommendations,2020-11-09 15:20:12+00:00,"What is the best camera lens combination for a food video channel? The answer is going to be different for different people. But in this video we go over our journey from the time we started working on Bong Eats in 2015 to this year when we finally hit a million subscribers.

We also include basic tips for shooting great looking food videos.

Special thanks to Sony for sending us the Sony a7iii full-frame camera, and loaning the Sony 90mm macro lens. Opinions are our own.

RsOMEcQ0GxY,Bong Eats,A Special Recipe + Exciting Pujo 2020 Announcement—Sienna Cafe × Bong Eats,2020-10-15 04:50:43+00:00,"Today's video and recipe are special. The indomitable Sienna Cafe team take over our channel to show us a breathtakingly beautiful and deliciously spicy noodle-soup, the Chitol Laksa Bowl (more on that in a bit).

📢 But first an exciting announcement: For the time time ever Bong Eats is partnering with Sienna Cafe to put together two very special menus for Durga Pujo 2020! 

🍤 The first is a four-day takeaway lunch menu—a different set of dishes each day from Sashti to Nabami—and, they all feature some of the most loved Bong Eats recipes. Book your order(s) for 22nd to 25th October 2020 now.
🛒 [ Pre-orders open now via WhatsApp at 919903608899 or click https://wa.me/919903608899 ]

🌮 Then in the evenings, there is going to be a second menu dedicated solely to snacks and appetisers. But these, instead of being straight-up Bong Eats recipes, are twists on our recipes by the two talented Sienna chefs, Auroni and Avinandan. This 'chop shop' will pop-up at the Hindustan Park outlet of Sienna Cafe from 20th to 25th October 2020.
🛒 [ Self-pickup from Sienna Cafe, Hindustan Park, or order via Zomato ]

----------------------------------------------------
FOR THE FULL MENU and ordering details go to https://bongeats.com/pujo2020
----------------------------------------------------

🍜 Back to the noodle-soup recipe. The Sienna team was kind enough to invite us to film this recipe at their Park Street outlet. Although for reasons of space (we're still in the pandemic after all!) and lighting we couldn't shoot this inside the Sienna kitchens, we did enjoy having the entire (now sadly empty) restaurant floor all to ourselves. Enjoy this hearty laksa recipe made with chitol fishballs, which Chefs Auroni and Avinandan break down for us to recreate at home. While you are at it enjoy their expert chopping and prepping styles, admire all their restaurant-grade equipment, and don't forget to stay on until the end as Auroni explains his thought process behind plating the laksa bowl for service.

In Auroni's words: 'At Sienna Store & Cafe, the kitchen family is always trying to look for inspiration in preparations and ingredients that are local. After all, we are an organisation that rose from a small workshop in Santiniketan and a tiny cafe from the bylanes of Calcutta. Chitol machh, especially muittha, is one such preparation that really is close to our hearts and bellies. We've had so many versions—served at pice hotels, at biye-baris, personally made by hand by thammas and mammas alike. But when our team tried the Bong Eats take on this classic, there was just so much inspiration—so very, many ideas. Our minds and palates went to another place, another level and ultimately arrived at this delicious and nourishing laksa bowl. This is our ode and tribute to their cooking and culinary craft. Hope you enjoy it and bon appetit!'

7qVyaZP7QQ8,Bong Eats,"Bhetki paturi recipe, 4 ways—Bhetki fillets steamed in banana-leaf parcels—Bengali fish paturi",2020-09-08 15:16:48+00:00,"Bhetki paturi, or bhetki machh'er kolapaturi, is a relatively new entrant in the Calcutta food scene. Ilish was the de facto fish for kola paturi, until rising prices and the challenges of picking out fine bones at wedding buffets while also trying to maintain at least the pretense of friendly conversation led to boneless bhetki fillets replacing ilish for catered events.

The fish fillets, smeared in thick mustard paste, can be individually wrapped in small parcels or can cooked all together, layered, in a larger leaf parcel—either steamed or pan fried on low heat. In this video we have shown you a few variations on the basic paturi marinade. We also decided to go out to the garden and cook the paturi on a clay oven over coal fire. This gives the paturi an undertone of smokiness, which is great for a white, non-oily fish like bhetki. We were inspired to try this on a clay stove after seeing Koyel Roy's Instagram post: https://www.instagram.com/chef.roykoyel/.

The fourth variation shown here is based on a recipe we found in the book ""Rakamari Amish Ranna"" by Renuka Debi Chowdhurani (🛒 https://www.amazon.in/dp/8172150849/?tag=bongeats0c-21)

rSktrPFc3ug,Bong Eats,Murgir Laal Jhol—a fiery red Bengali chicken curry,2020-08-01 16:40:53+00:00,"Murgir jhol or Bengali chicken curry recipe: Jhol refers to the runniest form of sauce in Bengali cooking. This chicken curry recipe is all about freshness of ingredients. It does away with everything but the essential. There is no tempering the oil with whole spices, no tomatoes and green chillies, none of the usual spices such as coriander and cumin, and no garnishing with coriander leaves. Which means that the few ingredients that do go in have to be fresh if you would like to achieve the best results.
Ideally, the chicken should be purchased from the market the same day, never frozen. The whole bird should not weigh more than 2 kg, about 1.7 kg after dressing. The meat should be bone-in, of course, preferably from the legs and thighs and not only from the breast. Necks, stomachs, livers and heads are good too.
The chilli paste is freshly ground along with a generous quantity of garlic and a little ginger. The quantity of onions is much less than what would be normally used. This is intentional. Avoid the temptation to use too much onion in this recipe. Because there is not enough onions or spices to give the gravy a body, when the water is added the emulsion breaks and the oil rises to the top giving it its signature red colour.
The yoghurt adds some acidity, but can be skipped too. The whole spices used are ground fresh in a sheel nora right before being added to the korai at the very end. The effect is very different from adding whole spices in the beginning of the cooking process. Finally, we like to finish with a drizzle of a good pungent, unrefined mustard oil. This is an optional step, but one we recommend you try at least once.‍

ppfvSqUPTmM,Bong Eats,Biulir dal or Kolai'er dal—easy Bengali dal recipe with fennel and ginger—Mashkolai er dal,2020-07-19 03:00:15+00:00,"Biuli'r dal or Kolai'er dal can be polarising. You either like its slimy texture, or you don't. Slime is a food texture that Bengali cuisine prizes. Young children are gently cajoled into eating slimy delicacies such as lady's fingers (dhyarosh), jute leaves (paat), malabar spinach (pui), certain types of taro (kochu), taro stolons (kochur loti) and so on. The indoctrination usually starts with the fried forms of these foods. In no time they graduate to other methods of cooking, that produce more slimy results. It is a slippery slope.

This recipe is how biulir dal is cooked in our Bangal (East Bengali immigrant) family. The dal is first dry roasted before being boiled. In other households, the dal may be boiled directly producing a more slimy consistency. The most important flavours here are of fennel seeds (mouri) and fresh ginger. This dal is commonly served with alu posto (potatoes cooked in a poppy seed paste) in West Bengali (ghoti) households.

dWhLs_YRyck,Bong Eats,Paat pata’r bora—jute leaf fritter recipe—monsoon special | Bengali vegetarian recipe,2020-07-11 12:58:32+00:00,"Paat pata’r bora: Possibly our favourite thing about the monsoons. Paat (পাট) is Bengali for jute, the same fibre that is used to weave gunny sacs or burlap. Jute is a plant native to Bengal and has been cultivated here for thousands of years. With the setting up of the first mechanised jute mill in India in Rishra in 1855, gunny sacs began to be exported all over the world. Even today 80 per cent of the world's jute is cultivated in the Gangetic delta. Naturally, jute leaves are used extensively in Bengali cuisine. When cooked, the leaf has a mild flavour, and a slightly slimy, fibrous (somewhat like mustard greens) texture. If you don't have access to jute leaves, you can also use spinach leaves to make this fritter.

We’ve made Bohri food before on this channel. We find Bohri cuisine a lot of fun to cook and eat. If you did not know, the Bohras are a small community in Calcutta—they have a bigger presence in places like Bombay and Gujarat. Many of us non-Bohris don’t actually get to eat Bohri food—unless, of course, we are lucky to have a friend from the community. Bohri food is nearly impossible to find in restaurants in Calcutta.

Since we are in the month of Ramzan, we thought we will show you some fun things to make from the Bohri cuisine. We have a good mix of easy, elaborate, vegetarian and meat dishes—so there should be something for everyone. 

Today we are making dal samosa, which is a variation of the keema samosa we already have on our channel, lagan ni seekh—kind of like a stove-top meatloaf, alu vada, and a milk based drink called hariro.

This was filmed on Sunday, 3rd May.

Recipes in this episode:
- Lagan ni seekh
- Dal na samosa
- Alu vada
- Hariro

GZ-2QJxDflM,Bong Eats,Classic lemon tart recipe with tricks to a perfect smooth tart shell—key lime pie,2019-12-13 06:09:20+00:00,"Lemon tart, or more accurately, lime and orange tart: When you bite into this tart, the creamy lemon custard hits your palette first, followed immediately by the buttery, crisp shortcrust pastry. The lime custard is as tart as it is sweet—it makes your face pucker at the first bite and jolts your senses into attention! With every subsequent bite you grow accustomed to the sourness. You start appreciating the contrast of the creaminess and the crunchiness, as well as the fragrance of the citruses—lime and orange in our case.

Follow this recipe and you will be gifted with a tart better than anything you can buy from a shop—that is because the tarts sold in most pastry shops in India are made to have longer shelf lives, and they skimp on the butter. They also rarely bake the custard in the shell, choosing instead to make it separately and pipe it in once cool. It certainly makes for a more substantial (and impressive) presentation to serve one large tart to your guests and cut it into wedges at the table, than the small mini tarts that are usually available in pastry shops. We hope you give this a try while the weather is still cool. DO NOT attempt this in the warmer humid months.

It was perfect as an appetiser. We got the basic recipe from our friend's mom. Then while researching for this video we also came across Bridget White-Kumar's recipe in one of her fabulous recipe books (links below). We combined the two recipes to create the recipe that you see here. As you can tell, this recipe can be easily modified to suit your tastes. You can make it sweeter and stickier, or make it more spicy, add other flavours and spices—the possibilities are endless. If you are new to cooking pork, we highly recommend this quick and easy pork ribs recipe.

Ruq6hLINRnU,Bong Eats,Beef nihari recipe—velvety beef or mutton shank stew—perfect for winters,2019-11-29 06:04:18+00:00,"Nihari or nahari recipe: Nahari is a breakfast stew in which beef or mutton shank containing all the good fat, marrow and bones is slow-cooked all night with spices. The result is a silky, flavourful, mild  warming shorba (soup) with the rich rogan (rendered fat or oil) floating on the surface. It is ideally had with a thick bread such as naan, which soaks up the shorba. 

While nihari is time-consuming, if you look at the recipe, it is requires very little work. The hardest part is assembling the long list of spices. After that it is just a matter of setting the pot on the stove or oven and letting it cook until the meat is soft and falls off the bones.
 
🙏🏾The nihari spice mix was adapted from Delhi-UP-Karachi-Khaane's YouTube channel, run by Mahmood Babar Ahmed. His channel is a treasure trove of reliable recipes. This is the video in question: https://youtu.be/hFTCIWhxm6M 

🍽In Calcutta, nihari is almost exclusively sold in the winter, sometimes with dal puri. Nihari from Sufia, Beeru's, Nafeel, UP Bihar restaurant are among the ones that are popular.

Nihari is a Mughlai dish that most likely originated in Delhi or Lucknow (some even say Hyderabad) towards the end of the Mughal rule. After Partition it has become very popular in Pakistan and Bangladesh where it is often sold as Delhi wali nihari.

jPb690-h5Tc,Bong Eats,"Rum balls recipe—decadent, chocolatey, rum-soaked treats for the holidays ahead",2019-11-22 04:54:00+00:00,"Rum balls recipe: Many Calcuttans have grown up eating rum balls from Kathleen, Nahoum's, or Flury's, and many more. Rum balls were developed as a way for bakeries to use up leftover cakes and trimmings, but they are delicious—very often tastier than the cakes they were made from! They are the perfect gifts for holiday parties, as they are easy to make, easy to transport and easy to consume without making a mess—but most importantly they are very rich, very satisfying, and they have rum! Could it BE any better?

In this recipe we are starting with a readymade fruitcake, but if you have some leftovers from a fruitcake you made, put it in your rum balls! Use the recipe as a guide because depending on the cake you are using the quantities of rum or corn syrup may need to be adjusted. If it is too shaggy, add more cake. If it is dry, add some rum. We are keeping the frosting simple by dipping the balls in dark chocolate, but there are many possible variations. Hope you give these a try!

H_n1njwIBbU,Bong Eats,Jhal suji—savoury semolina with seasonal vegetables—Bengali tiffin or breakfast recipe,2019-11-15 04:37:37+00:00,"Jhal suji or nonta suji recipe: This is a Bengali take on the widely known upma or savoury semolina snack that is eaten all over India in one form or the other. ""Jhal suji"" is simply savoury or spicy suji. This is to differentiate it from the ""mishti suji"" or sweet semolina preparations. This recipe is perfect as an evening snack or even as packed school lunch, AKA tiffin for kids.

What makes a great jhal suji? It is fluffy and not lumpy. The end product should look like wet sand with separate grains glistening with ghee. Yet, it is perfectly soft and moist, and should not feel dry when eating. 

This can be achieved by paying attention to two things—first, there has to be enough fat to coat the semolina grains. This keeps them separate and prevents clumps. Second, the proportion of semolina to water has to be such that it cooks the semolina to perfect softness, but there is no extra water leftover.

Apart from these two (in our opinion) desirable characteristics, how you flavour your jhal suji, or what vegetables you put in it, is entirely up to you. Decisions such as whether to put onions, ginger, garlic, the choice of nuts and dried fruits, or the vegetables depends on the season, or what you like. The idea is to add different textures that break the monotony of the semolina, while also providing flavours and nutrition.

w8Y6ciDKdVo,Bong Eats,Chicken white stew recipe—Kolkata cabin-style Bengali chicken stew—Kolkata street food,2019-11-08 03:54:16+00:00,"Chicken stew recipe: Chicken stew is a firm favourite among office-goers in Calcutta, especially in the central business district of Dalhousie. Go to Chitta babu’r dokan (shop) on Dacre’s lane at any time of the day and you will find the wooden benches on the sides of the lane filled with workers taking a quick break over stew, buttered toast, and tea. The YMCA canteen in College street on the other hand pulls a younger crowd of mostly university students. If you are looking for a chicken stew in a more relaxed environment, you can amble into Cafe in Bhawanipur later in the evening. They serve a delicious brown stew every day of the week except on Thursdays, when they serve a special white stew. It is the perfect spot for catching up with a friend.

Our chicken stew recipe is loosely based on the mutton white stew recipe that we came across in Renuka Debi Choudhurani’s ""Rakamari Amish Ranna"". We have also added elements from the different stews that we like in the city. Give this a try while the vegetables are in season!

kzVcz8X_waw,Bong Eats,Macher kalia recipe with Katla or Rui—Bengali fish kaliya—Bengali fish curry for special occasions,2019-11-01 05:10:49+00:00,"Machh'er kalia recipe: Kalia and qorma are the two pillars of Mughlai cuisine. Qorma has a base of ghee—water even if it is added for cooking is eventually dried off. Kalia, in contrast, is water- or milk-based and the final dish is runnier. Qorma is for special occasions, while kalia is more of an everyday preparation. Of course, this kalia, and other Bengali kalias, are heavily modified from the original Mughal kalia—which were not as fiery. These probably developed under the Nawabs of Bengal incorporating local ingredients and tastes. 

This machh'er kalia is made with paka (mature, i.e. 3 kg or more) rui or katla—both of which are freshwater carps very popular in Bengal. It is best if you can buy a live katla weighing 3–4 kg and cook it the same day. Our recipe is moderately high on chillies which is nicely counterbalanced by the sourness of the yoghurt and tomatoes, as well as the sweetness from the fried onions, sugar and raisins. You may even add fried potatoes to the gravy if you prefer. Serve this with plain boiled rice or with a polao (link below).

-QzDTb6tqHw,Bong Eats,Narkel'er naru recipe gur diye—coconut sweet with sugarcane jaggery—Bijoya special mishti,2019-10-11 04:50:20+00:00,"Narkel gur'er naru recipe: Coconut (narkel or narkol in Bengali) is a very important part of Bengali cooking and lifestyle in general. Bengalis are known for their chhana'r (cottage cheese) sandesh, but that is much more recent phenomenon. Sweets made from coconut and jaggery have been around for thousands of years. If you look at the simplicity of a recipe like narkel naru— made with just two ingredients and shaped with hands—you will quickly realise that this is something we have been eating for ages. There are so many more fancier sweets in the Bengali cook's repertoire now, and yet is there anything that signifies Bijoya Dashami better than this humble lump of coconut and sugarcane jaggery? Why do we keep reaching for the jar of naru when there is no dearth of intricate and refined desserts? It is because the naru connects us to all the people who came before us, who lived and loved ate narus here in this fertile land that we call home.

8dAf3UetAtw,Bong Eats,Labra tarkari recipe—Very special Bengali niramish khichuri-labra for Durga or Lokkhi pujo'r bhog,2019-10-04 07:44:37+00:00,"Labra tarkari recipe: Growing up in a Bangal (immigrant East Bengali) household in a refugee colony, Lokkhi pujo was the biggest pujo at home. The sudden emptiness one feels knowing that Durga pujo is over was somewhat ameliorated by the knowledge that Lokkhi pujo is just around the corner. On the eve of Lokkhi pujo, heaps of vegetables would be cut and prepped for the array of dishes that were to accompany thamma's bhuna khichuri (a dry polao like khichuri). The star of the show—aside from the bhuna khichuri—was thamma's labra'r torkari. On the evening of Lokkhi pujo friends, family and neighbours would sit down to eat thamma's bhuna khichuri and labra. The next morning, we would have the leftovers for breakfast. Some family members argue that it tastes better stale than on the same day.

This recipe was passed on to thamma (my paternal grandmother, Durga) by her mother-in-law, my great grandmother. It has a particular set of vegetables cooked in a specific order. Family recipes differ based on which vegetables go into the labra—in our family, for example, mulo (radish), common in many households, is not added.

NzH3EzqOCVE,Bong Eats,Fish kabiraji cutlet recipe—Mitra Cafe-style kabiraji cutlet—Durga pujo special Kolkata street food,2019-09-27 05:32:03+00:00,"Fish kabiraji cutlet recipe: Kabiraji cutlet is a dish unique to Calcutta. It is served in cafe-style restaurants called 'cabins'. The cooked fish, chicken, or mutton cutlet is covered in a fluffy, crispy web of beaten egg batter to form a Kolkata kabiraji cutlet. 

There can be two different styles of this crispy outer covering. The first, simpler style is to simply dip the cutlet in the egg batter before putting it in hot oil, followed by pouring the remaining egg batter onto the cutlet while turning it. This produces a style of kabiraji that you may see at Apanjan in Rashbehari.

The second style—the one we have used in this recipe—takes a little more practice, and produces a more flamboyant looking kabiraji cutlet. In this style, you have to dip your fingers in the batter and swing your wrists over a large pan to form thin strands of the egg batter that slowly form an airy, crunchy carpet as they hit the hot oil. The cooked cutlet is then placed on one end of this carpet and turned and rolled so that the web cocoons the cutlet and forms an impressive looking 'coverage'. This style of kabiraji is served at places like Mitra Cafe in Sobhabazar.

As you can see from the video, this can and will get messy—so the trick to getting the kabiraji right is to let go of your worries and focus on getting you the mesh perfect. If some of the egg batter falls on your stove—try not to think about it ;)

otevgmY-xPs,Bong Eats,Fish fry recipe—Apanjan-style—Bengali fish cutlet with Bhetki—Pujo special Kolkata street food,2019-09-20 05:16:46+00:00,"Bengali fish fry recipe: A fish fry or diamond fry in Calcutta is a crumb-coated fillet of bhetki—something that would be called a fish cutlet elsewhere. Fish fry is served by cabin-style restaurants, small take-away shops, street food vendors, as well as in catered events such as weddings. 
Calcutta has no dearth of good fish fries. Some of the ones we love include Badshah (Jadavpur), Mitra Cafe (Sobhabazar), etc. For this recipe, we wanted to recreate our favourite fish fry, which comes from a shop named Apanjan (আপনজন) in Kalighat. Apanjan's large fish fries are even bigger than the size we ended up using.
We received a lot of technical inputs from jethu (Saptarshi's uncle) Sujit Chakraborty—who besides being a great cook, has been running a catering business for the last 30 years. 
Over the course of testing this recipe, we visited several markets in Calcutta. If you want bhetki fillets the best place to go to is Fish Range, New Market. The shop we purchased our fillets from was called A.K.G. & Co. The owner, Atanu Gurey, was patient and helpful, and his staff adept at creating perfect, uniform rectangles of fish exactly to our size specification. We have shown the whole process of filleting the whole bhetki both for documentation, and for anyone who may be interested in learning to do it themselves.

Following jethu's suggestion we kept our marinade simple, using only green chillies, coriander and flat-leaf or Italian parsley. We also tried adding mint, but preferred the version without better. You are, however, free to play around with the flavours as long as you keep the ratio of the marinade to the fish constant.

34I_PRyaVGo,Bong Eats,"Mutton roll recipe, Nizam's style—with perfect mutton kathi kabab instructions—Kolkata street food",2019-09-13 05:29:51+00:00,"Kolkata mutton roll recipe: The kathi kabab and the kathi kabab roll originated at Nizam's on Hogg Street, Calcutta. As long time viewers will know, at Bong Eats, making a roll every pujo has become kind of a tradition. After our last two years' egg and chicken roll recipes, this year we wanted to return to where it all began. The classic roll at Nizam's restaurant is different from most other kathi rolls in Calcutta. Nizam's mutton roll is all about simplicity. A thin, crisp paratha wraps succulent, slightly chewy mutton kababs with some onions, green chillies, and lots of lime juice. That's it. No ketchup, no green chilli sauce, no other condiments. Unlike most other well known roll shops in Kolkata that use lachhha or layered paratha, Nizam's paratha is thin, single layered and shallow fried in very hot oil. This gives the paratha the blistered brown outside and the soft inside—so it can be easily rolled without cracking. The mutton kathi kabab, called so because the kababs are cooked on kathi or bamboo skewers instead of the usual metal skewers, is quite brilliant too. Because the roll is so simple, it lets the main components—the paratha and the kabab—take centre stage. That is why it is essential that the kabab and paratha both be perfect. Do give this a try!

Jhal muri sellers set up their shops outside schools, colleges, railway stations, parks—anywhere people need a light, affordable evening snack. Our favourite jhal muris are those served on trains during long journey by traveling vendors who board the train with their jhal muri setup serve jhal muri to hungry (or bored) passengers, and then get off the train at another station. They keep traveling back and forth on certain routes all day selling delicious jhal muri. Apparently there is this British man who came to Calcutta, fell in love with jhal muri and now he has set up a jhal muri stall in London that Londoners seem to love!

If you are trying to impress your guests, this is the dal to make. That is why this dal finds place in wedding lunches, first rice ceremonies, or anytime you invite guests over for an afternoon feast. To make this dal you need the freshest fish head you can find, and guess what is the best way to ensure the fish head is fresh? You buy a live fish! You could use any large freshwater fish head for this, but the Bengali favourite is the head of a large katla fish—a delicious freshwater carp. This is commonly served with a bhaja (any fried dish) such as beguni (video link below) or jhuri alu bhaja (video link below). If you are buying good quality fresh fish and not eating the head, you are missing out.

DcZki5Dknww,Bong Eats,Kumro’r chokka—delicious braised sweet pumpkin and potatoes—Bengali vegetarian recipe: Pujo special,2019-08-16 03:57:36+00:00,"Kumro'r chokka recipe (also known as kumror chhoka): If you have never tasted kumror chokka you will be shocked by how good this tastes. Just ripe sweet pumpkins braised slowly with potatoes, and a few other garnishes like Bengal gram and grated coconut produce a dish that is certain to find a place in your regular repertoire. The vegetables really shine in this recipe, but the other key flavours are those of bhaja moshla (recipe link below), and ghee. Luchi with kumror chokka used to be a fixture on wedding menus until a few years ago, but has slowly fallen out of favour. But it shouldn't! Bring chokka back, we say!

hOv7Rk7bHtI,Bong Eats,Mutton burra kabab—tender mutton chops kabab—Bakri Eid special—Mughlai kabab recipe,2019-08-09 06:00:41+00:00,"Mutton Burra kabab: Our first encounter with mutton burra was at old Delhi's Karim's. It is hard to believe that mutton chops cooked over dry heat in a tandoor can yield a kabab so succulent—such was the genius of the Mughlai cook. The long marination with yoghurt and papaya paste leads to a tender kabab—but you have to be careful not to overdo the marination or you will either end up with meat falling off the bones as it roasts in the oven, or kababs that are mushy and have no texture. The ideal burra kabab should offer some resistance when you try to tear off the meat, but it should not be too chewy or dry.The recipe is quite hassle free. You put all the ingredients for the marinade (except the yoghurt) into a grinder and prepare a smooth paste, that you apply to the meat and then bake it either in a tandoor, or a barbecue, or a regular home oven. Since we are not using a tandoor, we smoked the meat using the dhungar method, and then charred it on an open flame just before serving.

vJ3iov8q65s,Bong Eats,Plastic chutney—fun Bengali chutney recipe,2019-07-26 04:40:50+00:00,"Plastic'er chutney recipe: For someone who has not grown up in Bengal, coming across plastic chutney on a wedding lunch menu may be startling—who would want to eat that! But this used to be (and still is) a fixture on catered menus, especially when fruits for making other chutneys are not in season. You have green mango chutney for summer, tomato amshotto chutney for winter, pineapple or kool'er chutney for spring—but for the months of monsoon through autumn there aren't that many suitable fruits. It must have been a smart caterer who thought of using the bland papaya to make a chutney, and then gave it a shocking (almost clickbait) name—""plastic chutney""— because of how glossy and translucent the papaya slices appear once cooked in the sugar syrup! Not our favourite chutney, but it definitely is interesting.‍

dwI7D2Kk9QU,Bong Eats,Chhyachra—machh'er matha diye pui chorchori—Bengali malabar spinach medley with fish head,2019-07-19 06:43:39+00:00,"Chhyachra (ছ্যাঁচড়া) is a form of pui chorchori (a mishmash/medley) made with fresh fish head—in this case head of katla (a large carp). Chhyachra (or chhachra) is a much loved special recipe for Bengalis. If you are trying to find it outside Bengal, pui leaves are often sold as Malabar spinach. It has a slightly slimy texture and a beautiful grassy flavour. Lots of other vegetables such as sweet potato, ripe pumpkin, potato and brinjal go into this dish. Another optional, but highly recommended addition is the kathal (jackfruit) seeds. They are starchy, sweet to taste and add a nutty flavour to the dish. Of course, the star of this dish is the fish head (machher matha). We don't recommend using frozen or stale fish head for this. If possible, get the head of a live fish from the market. That will give it the best flavour minus any nasty odours.

Y9iujFS8lx4,Bong Eats,Peyaji—simple Bengali onion fritters for rainy evenings—Easy Bengali snack,2019-07-05 05:07:49+00:00,"Peyaji recipe: Deep fried onion fritters—because who doesn't like fried onions? Even within India there are lots of variations of onion pakoras. They all follow a similar set of ingredients, but the beauty lies in the small deviations. The basic Bengali peyaji (also called Peyaju in Bangladesh) is made with just five ingredients—onions, green chillies, besan, salt, and sugar. But the trick to great peyaji, like any fried dish, is in controlling the moisture. The drier the batter, the crispier the peyaji. Substituting part of the gram flour with rice flour and regular flour also helps keep the peyaji crisp longer. So when the clouds rumble, make some peyaji. It is quick, easy and delicious.

bIp0Sa5clsA,Bong Eats,"Pepe’r Shukto—a delicious, mildly bitter, milky appetiser with papaya—easy Bengali shukto recipe",2019-06-21 05:58:07+00:00,"Pepe’r shukto recipe: The grand Bengali panchmishali shukto with lots of vegetables, cooked individually to the perfect doneness, and assembled carefully in the end, isn't for everyday. This quick and easy shukto on the other hand is perfect for weekdays and requires very few ingredients. For the bitter element we have used bitter gourd leaves in this video. Bitter gourd leaves can be hard to find if you don't have a garden—you can easily substitute it with thankuni pata (centella, Asiatic pennywort or Gotu kola) which is easier to buy from the market.

ℹ️By definition, a shukto is a mild, sometimes bitter, milky curry that is eaten after shaak (greens) and before dal (lentils). As such, it is not the name of a single dish, as is commonly believed, but an entire category of curries (like dalna or ghonto) in its own right. Lau'er shukto (made with bottle gourd), shosha'r shukto (cucumber), and dhula shaak'er shukto are some of the other kinds of shukto known today, albeit among few families. Within the structure of the Bengali meal, shukto is eaten right at the beginning. It is said to stimulate the appetite and prepare the palate for the oncoming spicier courses.

This no-cook snack made with sabu (sabudana in Hindi) is perfect for the hot and humid days when cooking can feel like a painful task even for those who love to cook. You really can use any fruit you like, but we have chosen Martaman bananas, sweet, ripe and fragrant Himsagar mangoes, and soft and juicy variety (gola) kathal or jackfruit. The grated coconut adds texture and flavour with every bite. The acidity from the Gandharaj lime (a lime found in Bengal that is similar in fragrance to kaffir lime) cuts through the sweetness to create the perfect balance. This is something we grew up eating for breakfast and sometimes for evening snack in late summer and monsoons when the mangoes and the jackfruits ripen.

In this video we have also given you detailed steps to cut/prep the small Mourola fish.

ABL3qguRomA,Bong Eats,Sheer Khurma—Eid Special Sweet Semai Recipe,2019-05-31 04:12:09+00:00,"Eid begins with the early morning special eid namaz (prayers), followed by breaking the month-long fasting period with sheer khurma. Sewai (or sev/semai), along with an assortment of dried fruits and nuts, is boiled in milk to produce this rich pudding. 

Our sheer khurma is of 'drinkable' consistency, although some people prefer it thicker, and we like it best hot (it's slurpable!). If you are making this recipe, try getting roasted sewai, rather than using the glassy vermicelli. Some viewers might not be familiar with a few of the fruits/nuts we've used, such as charoli seeds and kharak (dried dates), but we promise you they are easily available in local markets, especially around this time of year, and it will be well worth the effort to try and procure them. This Dawoodi Bohra–style sheer khurma is made extra-special with the addition of poppy seeds and grated coconut. 

CREDIT
This is a family recipe, but we are grateful to the channel

Since the stuffing of chhatu needs no cooking, it is very easy to make.

This porota is most common in Bihar and was likely popularised in Bengal by Bihari migrants or picked up by the large population of Bengalis who lived in Bihar or bordering districts.

tT_N5n5mLrs,Bong Eats,Mutton Haleem Recipe—Ramzan special haleem,2019-05-17 05:22:36+00:00,"Mutton haleem recipe: Although the dish probably originated in Hyderabad, haleem is a dish that is closely associated with Ramzan in Calcutta. During the month of Ramzan when people fast during the day, haleem is often used to break the fast after sundown. Meat and grains are gently simmered in a giant hnari or cauldron for the entire day and are ready to be relished after the evening prayers. Haleem is usually had on its own or sometimes with some kind of a bread such as a tandoori roti or a naan. Many Calcuttans irrespective of their religion (even the ones not fasting) flock in front of New Aaliah in Chandni Chowk, Arafat near Eliot Road, Aminia, Arsalan, and Shiraz for their haleem. 

This recipe for mutton haleem has been adapted for cooking at a small scale at home. The use of pressure cooker cuts down on the cooking time at the cost of flavour and texture. To make up for that we are cooking the grains in a concentrated mutton stock made from paya, that is, trotters of a goat. The slow simmering of bones and connective tissue over a long time extracts a lot of flavour and gelatin into the stock. This gelatin is what gives haleem its mouthfeel and consistency. If you don’t have the patience, you could skip this step and just use water. It will still taste great.

PhERAAARNbc,Bong Eats,Chhana'r polao—Tagore family recipe of rich paneer polao for Rabindranath's birthday,2019-05-03 09:31:59+00:00,"Chhana'r polao: A Tagore family recipe from the book Amish o Niramish Ahar by Pragyasundari Debi on the occasion of Rabindranath Tagore's birthday on 9 May. This exquisite polao, prepared with freshly made chhana or paneer, is hands down one of the best polaos we have tasted.  This vegetarian polao, laden with pistachio, almonds, raisins, ghee, spices, saffron and rose water, seems to be influenced by Persian cooking in not just the ingredients it uses, but also in the technique it follows in achieving the delicate balance between decadence and subtlety. 

Every year we commemorate Rabindra Jayanti (birth anniversary of the Bengali poet laureate, Rabindranath Tagore) on our channel, by cooking one of the recipes from cookbooks authored by members of the illustrious Tagore family. In nineteenth and early-twentieth century Bengal, the Tagores held a prominent position in social, cultural and political life. Although Rabindra Jayanti is the birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore, well known for his contribution to Bengali poetry, music, education and publishing, we take this opportunity every year to celebrate the work of some of the women of this family, especially that related to the culture surrounding food. The Tagores were steadfastly modern in their outlook, and the recipes cooked in their household—some of them extremely quirky—reflect their sense of being part of a larger world beyond Bengal.

At tiffin breaks, or after school, children gather around the tiny makeshift stand that the alu kabli seller sets up with all the mise en place—boiled potatoes, chopped onions, green chillies, containers of alu kabli masala and salts, bunches of coriander leaves, a bowl of tamarind pulp and lime—ready to rustle up fresh chaat. As the alu kabli kaku (uncle) chops the potatoes with a rickety knife, sprinkles the spices, squeezes the lime, the tamarind pulp and tosses everything together, children stand around and watch with rapt attention, mouths watering. Within minutes freshly made alu kabli is filled into tiny thongas (small pockets) made from old newspaper and handed out—to be hungrily devoured and shared with friends.

BS4qU-Lstv4,Bong Eats,Dharosh/bhindi shorshe—okra in mustard-poppy (posto)—vegetarian Bengali dharosh recipe,2019-04-19 04:51:17+00:00,"Bengali bhendi or dharosh sorshe recipe: For many Bengalis dharosh or okra isn't their favourite vegetable. But this recipe of okra fried and coated in a mildly pungent sauce of ground mustard and poppy seeds may be one of the best ways to eat dharosh. The trick is to fry the okra on high heat until it is quite brown and cooking the sauce separately—only adding the fried dharosh in the end. This ensures that the bhendi has maximum flavour due to the caramelising of the sugars in the vegetable, and that it retains some texture instead of turning into a slimy, sloppy mess. Serve with dal and hot plain rice.

The word 'dhoka' means 'betrayal', so this dish is common on days when families eat a vegetarian fare, and trick themselves into believing the lentil cake, made flavourful with spices, coconut, peanuts, etc., is actually meat! 🤷🏽‍♀️ It is a rather typical Bengali treat, cooked for guests and special occasions.

9EPeCZkvhhA,Bong Eats,Chicken Korma Recipe: Noboborsho Special—Old-Delhi or Mughlai-Style Easy Chicken Korma,2019-03-29 05:24:31+00:00,"Various types of kormas exist, but this recipe in particular is based on the Delhi-style korma, sometimes called 'shahi korma' or 'Mughlai korma'. Kormas are rich, special dishes that were eaten on special occasions, unlike kaliya which was lighter and considered everyday food. 

Korma was created in the Mughal court and further evolved in the court of the nawabs of Oudh. Korma—as we know it in the India, Pakistan and Bangladesh—is a result of the fusion of Persian, Central Asian and Indian way of cooking.

🥘 RECIPE WITH INGREDIENT LIST 📝
https://bongeats.com/recipe/mughlai-chicken-korma/
__

According to author Rana Safvi, for this kind of korma, which she grew up with, no turmeric or tomatoes would be used. Kormas are cooked in lots of yoghurt, and the sweetness of the fried onion and the nuts balances the acidity and salt. Kormas are also cooked entirely in ghee, but we have used a combination of neutral oil and ghee instead. Obviously, the ghee-only version will taste better. We have also gone easy with the cream, using it only for garnishing. This is not for health reasons—we genuinely feel that this particular version of korma tastes better if the cream is kept to a minimum.

This uchhe or korola kumro bhaja is one of the easier 'teto' dishes to start with when introducing someone to bitters for the first time, since uchhe is not as bitter as, say, neem leaves, and the sweetness of pumpkin makes the bitterness less noticeable. 

This 'teto' course is very important to a Bengali lunch, specially in the spring when the season changes from cold and dry to hot and humid.

BI1v4Y8Td_M,Bong Eats,Aloo Posto Recipe—Tips and Tricks—Easy and Quick Bengali Vegetarian Recipe,2019-03-01 03:55:07+00:00,"Alu posto is a classic Bengali dish. Sparing in its use of spices, this preparation relies on the flavours of potatoes, green chillies and nigella seeds for its taste. What stands out, however, is the nutty flavour of the roasted poppy paste, which also provides body and texture to the gravy. This apparently bland-looking dish with just potato and posto is capable of rousing much passion in Bengalis. 

Although alu posto is cooked without onion or garlic, in our family we sometimes add a little fried onion to the alu posto for a pleasant variation.

HHdDtftfA-U,Bong Eats,Chicken Lollipop—Drums of Heaven—includes cutting steps—Calcutta Indo-Chinese,2019-02-22 07:09:12+00:00,"Chicken Lollipop—Drums of Heaven recipe: Any meal in chinatown in Calcutta must begin with some chicken lollipops, washed down with some fresh lime soda. This particular recipe is based on the drums of heaven that used to be served at Songhay on Waterloo Street. It is very simple. The hardest part for a beginner is to form the chicken lollipops from chicken wings. We have tried to give you a detailed step-by-step guide to forming your own chicken lollipops at home.

The second important detail is to get the chicken marination and frying right, so that the drums of heaven turn out crispy with only a thin coating. The sauce can be customised to your taste. Just make sure it has a sticky and thick consistency before adding the fried wings.

If making a large batch, you can fry the lollipops and make the sauce in advance. Then you can re-fry the wings at a high temperature for a minute, re-heat the sauce, and toss to coat just before serving. This is the only way to ensure the wings are crispy when you serve them.

A kitchen tool is anything that you use in the kitchen to cook food. While having the right equipment for the right job does make life easier, at the end of the day a kitchen tool is just a vehicle for your skills. 

LIST OF KITCHEN TOOLS at https://bongeats.com/kitchen (contains affiliate links)

Not everybody needs everything, and with that in mind, we’ve classified the items on this list in three broad categories. If you’ve been following this series from the beginning, you will be familiar with the BASIC, EXPERT and NINJA tags. It is worth stressing that you can cook delicious food even without a lot of these tools—tools are just a matter of convenience.

Last week we spoke about pantry essentials with a long shelf life. Today, we delve into some other kitchen essentials that are equally important in running a kitchen, but as they go bad more quickly, they need to be replenished more frequently—say, about once a week or so. These are the things you ideally would check to see if you have at home before you head out for your weekly bajaar. So, no matter what other vegetable, fish or meat you’re planning to buy that week, these are things you should never run out of in your kitchen.

We have divided our Bengali pantry essentials into three broad categories based on priority, starting from the very basics to more specialised items for advanced cooks. Even though we've approached this from the perspective of a Bengali kitchen, this list could very easily be adapted for Indian cooking in general.

This preparation is best made when cauliflower is in season during the winter months. The stalk of such cauliflower is kochi (tender), which means not only that it is less fibrous than off-season cauliflower stalk but that it is also less astringent. Other vegetables in this chorchori—potatoes, pumpkin, brinjal, tomatoes—add a variety of flavours and textures. The dominant spice is mustard paste, which lends it a fiery character. The phulkopi'r data, though cooked twice—first steamed and then sautéed—retain their bite. Fried dal'er bori (sun-dried lentil dumplings) adds nuttiness and crunch to contrast with the otherwise mushy texture of the chachchari. 

Bengali cuisine is littered with dishes that make use of ancillary parts of vegetables that would normally be thrown away—peels, leaves, stalk and so on. Bengal, which has lived through large-scale travesties including major famines and Partition, has had to be resourceful when it comes to sustenance. Cooks in the past may have turned to scraps, not-so-fresh vegetable rejects at the bajar, and tough, fibrous parts of plants that no one thought to eat previously to feed their families, but in the process they created dishes that have become embedded in the Bengali culinary tradition.

wENVDMMG-Ks,Bong Eats,Phena Bhaat—Bengali Rice Congee—Quick & Easy Comfort Food | Sheddo Bhaat / Bhaate-Bhat,2019-01-04 03:42:15+00:00,"Phena Bhaat (ফেনা ভাত), also known as phensa bhaat, bhaate bhaat, or sheddho bhaat is a starchy rice gruel or porridge made with fragrant, short-grained, raw (non-parboiled, আতপ) rice such as gobindobhog or kalijira. Various types of seasonal vegetables are added to the rice for both flavour and nutrition.

We also like to add some mosur dal (red lentils) or moog dal (yellow mung lentils) along with the rice. This makes phena bhaat a one-pot meal that cooks in 15 minutes. Phena bhaat is served steaming hot with a spoon of ghee, butter or mustard oil. Boiled or fried egg is a common accompaniment. Any kind of bhaja (fries) like fried fresh fish or potatoes, or leftover torkaris (vegetable preparations), can be served on the side.

Many Asian paddy growing cultures have an equivalent of phena bhaat. The most well known variant is congee.

dtyekBblwkA,Bong Eats,Chocolate Cake with Rich Chocolate Ganache—Christmas Special Easy Cake Recipe,2018-12-21 04:38:16+00:00,"As we bring the 2018 Christmas celebrations on this channel to a close, we leave you with a perfect dessert to ring in the new year. Our rich chocolate cake is constructed in two tiers. The sponge is moist and delicate, and melts in your mouth. Sandwiched between the sponges and smothered around them is a silky, decadent dark-chocolate ganache. This is a cake for birthdays and special occasions. But let's be real, you (and we) would eat this any day of the week.

LIST OF INGREDIENTS: at https://bongeats.com/recipe/chocolate-cake/

The tender crumb structure of the sponges comes largely from emulsifying the fat in the other liquids. Also unusual is this recipe's use of boiling hot water, which apart from reducing gluten (which tends to make cakes chewy) also helps with the emulsion. Here, we'd be remiss if we didn't credit ChefSteps' chocolate cake recipe (linked below). Can't thank them enough for turning us on to the hot-water technique. We've made several chocolate cakes in our day, and this was by far the best we've had.

Fy7GR2u_3oo,Bong Eats,Beef Pot Roast—Christmas Special Anglo-Indian Recipe—Slow-Cooked Beef Chuck Roast,2018-12-14 05:45:29+00:00,"Beef pot roast is a classic dish that manages to be comforting and flamboyant at the same time. It is perfect for the Christmas dinner! As you can tell a braised slow-cooked recipe like this is flexible. You can use different condiments, different flavourings, herbs, spices, use stock, tomato puree, or wine instead of plain water for the braising liquid—just as long as you stick to the basic process it should be good. The pot roast recipe in this video is from Patricia Brown's 'Anglo Indian Food and Customs', although the technique has been modified in places based on Kenji Lopez-Alt's pot roast recipe in his book 'The Food Lab'.

Since the beef cooks for a long time in the braising liquid please don't add salt to the gravy until the end or else by the time everything is reduced down it may be too salty. We have trussed the roast, because it makes for a nicer presentation. You can easily skip this step if you want.

The leftovers of the roast are perfect for making jhalfrezi—another Anglo-Indian favourite.

dzChtmsH7Bs,Bong Eats,Vindaloo Recipe—Anglo-Indian Recipe—Christmas Special,2018-12-07 05:27:41+00:00,"Pork vindaloo is hot-sour-spicy, almost pickle-like, braise of fatty pork with lots of garlic, vinegar and chillies. Vindaloo was born in Goa sometime in the 16th or 17th century after the Portuguese set up colony there. The word vindaloo comes from the Portuguese recipe 'vino de alhos' where 'vino' refers to (wine) vinegar and 'alho' is the word for garlic. Vindaloo is a fusion of Portuguese, Goan and South Indian ingredients and cooking. 

This particular recipe comes from the book 'Curry: A Tale of Cooks and Conquerors' by Lizzie Collingham. The book, besides being one of the best writings on Indian food history, has some fantastic recipes such as this one. We looked at a lot of recipes, both online and in books, but honestly this recipe of vindaloo—though a little more elaborate in the number of spices—is in our opinion one of the best.

Considering just how good this vindaloo tastes, it is really easy to make if you have all the ingredients. While the original recipe used pork, you can use duck instead of pork too.

mB3ImCyk7NU,Bong Eats,Steamed Carrot-Ginger Pudding with Tea-Custard (Crème Anglaise)—Anglo-Indian Recipe for Christmas,2018-11-30 03:00:02+00:00,"Steamed puddings are old-fashioned desserts that were common in England before households had reliable ovens. Steamed puddings lie somewhere in the middle of the cake–pudding continuum—neither as light and airy as a cake, nor as silky and moist as a modern pudding. We loved its unique texture when we tried it! This recipe is based on the original recipe in 'Anglo-Indian Food and Customs' by Patricia Brown. We turned what was originally a carrot steamed pudding into a ginger pudding by adding ginger—both paste and candied. We also changed the proportions to match the sweetness and the texture that we wanted.

Steamed puddings are commonly served with a custard sauce—crème anglaise—which we decided to infuse with tea. The idea of a ginger pudding with a tea sauce sounded perfect, and to our surprise it really works!

Steamed puddings are traditionally made in pudding basins, which are made of metal or ceramic. Some have lids and some—like the one we are using—need to be covered with a foil and baking paper with a pleat that allows the pudding to expand. It also has a lip which lets you tie a string around it and create a sling with which the pudding pot can be safely lowered into and retrieved from the pot of boiling water. 

If you enjoy the history of food and are not afraid to try something new you should try this recipe.

With only a handful of ingredients and very little effort this easy Bengali dal has the power to surprise you. It tastes even better in winter when both tomatoes and coriander (leaves) are in season. But even in summer it is great with a squeeze of gondhoraj lime (a kaffir-like lime indigenous to Bengal). The key to perfecting this dal is to not cook the masoor and the mung dal too much so that they retain their texture. For this reason we have made this without a pressure cooker since an open pot gives you more control and it does not really take long to cook anyway. This moong-masoor dal can be served with batter fried vegetables such as the phulkopi'r bora (cauliflower fritter) shown here or with any tarkari (vegetable dish) of your choice.

While the Bengali chire'r polao may not occupy the glorious place that kande pohe occupies in Marathi households, it is loved nonetheless and is ideal for school tiffin boxes just as fresh winter vegetables such as cauliflower, peas and carrots start to make an appearance in the bazar.

DzJkuI9UwYI,Bong Eats,Phulkopir Shingara Recipe with Perfect Folding Technique—Winter Special Bengali Spicy Stuffed Pastry,2018-11-09 04:00:00+00:00,"Eating phulkopi'r singara is best described as transcendental experience. Time stops still, and after you are done everything else in life seems to hold little attraction. Now that you have been warned, let us talk about the phulkopi'r shingara itself.

Phulkopi'r shingara means shingara made with cauliflowers. This means that to make this shingara you must use only the best seasonal cauliflowers. In Bengal cauliflowers are in season in winter. The shingara is ubiquitous all over Bengal, yet a proper shingara recipe is surprisingly hard to come by. All of the recipes we have found on the internet or cookbooks are ""home-style"" and don't taste like the spicy, jhaal (hot) and mildly sweet shingara sold in sweet shops and chop'er dokan (small fried goods shops). We figured out the recipe of the shingara filling around 2010 and since then have been guarding it like a secret. Today we are publishing it for everyone.

Another common problem with most of the shingara recipes on the internet is that the folding technique is not exactly right. The base of the singara actually has a double fold, creating four layers. It is quite difficult to get right, but we found help in YouTuber Selina Rehman's shingara video. Her video is the only video that shows this technique in a way that is easy to follow.  It can be used to fold samosas as well.

This recipe is laborious, no doubt, but if you follow the measures to the T you will have made one of the best shingaras you have had.

_LFgY4GGq60,Bong Eats,The Perfect Spicy Alur Tarkari for Kochuri—Spicy Bengali Potato Curry,2018-11-02 03:00:02+00:00,"This spicy kochuri'r alu'r tarkari (as our friends will testify) is our secret recipe that we have guarded with our life for eight years. We arrived at it through various permutations and combinations in 2010, and since then have been making this at every luchi-aloo torkari party for loved ones. After two years of running this channel, we are finally revealing this to our viewers with a mixture of reluctance and joy. Please use this recipe responsibly.

Of course this alur tarkari is not our invention. However, there are no real recipes that we have found anywhere on the internet or in recipe books.

It is the quintessential mishtir dokaner alu'r torkari that is made in sweet shops, as well as Bihari Kochuri shops in Bengal, and served with either hinger kochuri, or luchi, or puri along with a lonka'r achaar (green chilli pickle) and a sweet chutney. Every shop makes it a little differently, but the basics are the same. 

Growing up, my favourite kochuri shop was this trio of shops in Sealdah market called Shuruchi, Mukhoruchi and Abhiruchi. Thousands of people everyday consumed huge wicker baskets full of hot hing kochuri served in shaal patar'r thonga (cones made from dried shaal leaves), topped with a ladle full of steaming hot spicy alu'r torkari. Another firm favourite is Maharani (actually Maharaja, but everyone we know calls it Maharani even though there is a shop actually called Maharani just down the road) on Lansdowne. If you go early in the morning you will find morning walkers gorging on kochuri alur torkari, followed by hot sweet pantua or jilipi and finally a big earthen cup of tea.

B_B0Is-OAFg,Bong Eats,"Bengali Egg Tadka/Veg Tarka Fry—Easy, Perfect Dhaba-style—Kolkata Street Food Recipes",2018-10-26 07:12:23+00:00,"Tadka dal (or, as Bengalis call it, torka'r dal) and roomali rooti is the Bengali's favourite fallback dinner. On the way back from work the tired Kolkata worker will often stop by at the street-side dhaba to buy an earthen pot of steaming egg torka and some roomali rooti. The tarka most likely comes from the city's Punjabi community that owns and operates famous dhabas such as Russel Punjabi Dhaba, Jai Hind Dhaba, Balwant Singh’s Eating House, Bachchan's Dhaba, and many more. These dhabas stay open late in the night and serve customers buttery tarka, rotis, chicken bharta, tandoori chicken, lassi, and tea.

In our recipe we have tried to emulate the tarka prepared on the streets, cooking it in two stages—once with the spices, and then finishing in small batches on a screaming hot pan for the smoky flavour. This two-step process is important to achieve the dhaba style tarka flavour. For the egg tarka just like the dhabas, we don't fry the eggs separately. Instead the eggs are whisked in and cooked briefly to give the egg tarka a creamy texture—the eggs get cooked in the residual heat leading to silky strands of egg instead of ending up dry, rubbery.

When they manage to get that coveted table, chances are, half of them are going to order a Chelo Kabab.

Our recipe shows two types of kababs—jujeh or chicken kabab and koobideh or minced lamb kabab served with buttered saffron rice (chelo), roasted tomatoes, onions, capsicum, a fried egg and last but not the least the crunchy delicious rice crust or tehdig/tah-dig.

For this festive video we wanted to recreate Calcutta Peter Cat's famous chelo kabab. But when researching this recipe, we fell down the rabbithole that is the world of Persian cuisine—so we figured why not make chelo kabab, Iran’s “national dish”, the way it would be made Iran. The main source for these recipes is Najmeih Batmanglij tome on Iranian cooking—Food of Life: Ancient Persian and Modern Iranian Cooking and Ceremonies. The spices used are more subtle than what we associate with kababs in Mughlai cuisine.

NfDXmzS7CsI,Bong Eats,Chicken Roll Recipe—Calcutta Kathi Roll with Kabab Filling & Paratha—Durga Pujo Special—ASMR Cooking,2018-09-28 04:45:12+00:00,"The Chicken Kathi Roll was born in Calcutta. Succulent pieces of chicken marinated in spices are cooked over charcoal, and served with sliced onions, lime, and green chillies—all wrapped in a flaky, mildly sweet porota (paratha). It is really simple! So, every component has to be perfected for it to really stand out.

In this recipe we show you the best way to make a dough for the ""kathi"" roll that yields a flaky yet soft paratha for the roll wrapper. We also make the chicken kababs from scratch. And because we make the kababs in the oven and not over charcoal, we have used the ""dhungar"" method to infuse smokiness.

Once you get the kabab and the porota right, you can play around with the filling according to your taste. We are pan-frying the kababs with onions and capsicum the way Hot Kathi Roll on Park Street does—but you can also serve the kababs with just sliced raw onions and chillies. Some people like a squeeze of tomato ketchup and green chilli sauce (another speciality that came out of the Calcutta Chinatown) on their roll, while some find the idea abhorrent!

sOKFdGDbzCI,Bong Eats,Dim'er Devil—Egg Devil—Calcutta Cabin Style Spicy Scotch Eggs—Kolkata Street Food—Durga Pujo Special,2018-09-21 03:02:03+00:00,"Dim'er Devil may sound like devilled eggs, but is in reality much closer to the Scotch egg or the Nargisi kofta. A basic dim'er devil has one or half an egg encased in a spicy wrapping. The outer wrapping is usually potato for egg devils sold in street-side stalls in Calcutta. In cabins or older dine in cafes/restaurants the egg is wrapped in minced meat cooked with spices. Finally, the whole thing is coated in breadcrumb or in a batter and deep-dried. Dim'er devil is served with kasundi, and a simple salad of onions, cucumbers and beetroots.

In this Durga-Pujo-special video we have chosen the more festive cabin-style dimer devil that is made with minced mutton. We have borrowed heavily from the Niranjanagar's devil recipe available on YouTube on the Uttar Bangla channel (linked below).

It is almost always garnished generously with chopped onions, cucumbers, ketchup and green chilli sauce (another Indian Chinese condiment that originated in Calcutta's Chinatown).

The complete Kolkata Phuchka Recipe: Phuchka is a way of life in Calcutta. Everyone has their favourite phuchkawala (phuchka seller). Every para (neighbourhood) has at least a few beloved phuchkawalas. They set up their stalls around four in the afternoon. They bring their already-fried phuchka papri or puris in huge bags and arrange them neatly in a huge wicker basket or a glass box covered with a bright red cloth. Then they start preparing their mise en place and mixing the tawk jol (sour water). By the time they are done, customers start gathering around them and the day's business starts.

QG5qrZwl520,Bong Eats,Two Easy Kumro Recipes—Kumro'r Bora & Kumro Bhaja—Bengali Fried Pumpkin Recipes,2018-08-31 03:41:35+00:00,"Kumro'r Bora and Kumro Bhaja are two easy Bengali pumpkin recipes that are common in a Bengali meal, especially in autumn and winter. The ripe sweet pumpkin (mishti kumro) is in season starting September and it starts making appearances everywhere. For example, in a Bangal household the Lokkhi Pujo'r bhog is incomplete without the five kinds of fried vegetables one of which is (kumro) pumpkin. Both of these are best served either with Khichuri (link below) or with Bhaja Moog Dal (link below) although you can eat it with any dal you like.

The name ""Kumro bhaja"" is literally the recipe of this dish--it is that easy! But in this video we show you a few important tips of cutting the pumpkin to create the perfect kumro bhaja.

Kumro'r bora is a pumpkin fritter. In our house we prefer using maida (plain flour) instead of besan (Bengal gram flour) because maida is neutral and does not overpower the beautiful sweet flavour of the mishti kumro. One could, of course use besan for the batter too. If you decide to go that way, use the batter mix from our beguni recipe.

It has to be cooked with care since a soft fish like Kajli breaks very easily. When we have fresh flavourful fish at hand, this light yet pungent curry with mustard oil (tel jhol) is our favourite, because it takes a step back and lets the fish shine. The coriander leaf garnish adds a nice freshness specially when coriander is in season (winter). Serve this with plain white rice and you will be amazed by the taste of this deceptively simple Bengali fish curry.

---------------------------------------------------
SPICE BANGLA Collab Video (Mutton Kosha): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevVOtAmdik
---------------------------------------------------
About this recipe: Patha'r Mangser Jhol, or Bengali Mutton Curry is a classic Bengali mutton dish. On Sundays, in any Bengali neighbourhood in Calcutta one can hear the whistles of the pressure cooker going off. The smell of mutton curry fills the air. In this video we show another slightly more time consuming but superior method of cooking the mutton covered in a kadai over a longer period of time. The perfect cooked mutton should neither be too soft, nor too chewy. This method gives the cook more control over how far to cook the mutton. Additionally, it yields a ""jhol"" (sauce) with more body. This is because the process of conversion of collagen (present in the connective tissue of meat) into gelatin requires time. There is no way to fasten this process. Cooking the meat for about two hours creates more gelatin, that leads to a more viscous sauce that coats the mouth and teeth when eating.

4ioJtDzQBT0,Bong Eats,Bohri Keema Samosa—Bakri Eid Special—Make Samosa/Spring Roll Wrapper at Home,2018-08-10 04:18:59+00:00,"Minced-mutton samosas are a speciality of the Bohra Muslim community. What sets these samosas apart from others with a meat filling is the fact that they are encased in wrappers made of whole-wheat flour (atta), which gives these samosas a depth of flavour. The wrappers must be thin, and to achieve that two rotis are oiled, dusted, joined, and literally rolled together to allow them to be stretched out thin. Once cooked, the two layers separate, giving two large, thin rotis that Bohris call 'per'. 

In this video we are using a gently spiced filling of mutton keema, but you could also use minced lamb, beef, or chicken. The filling contains generous quantities of spring onions, coriander leaves, and mint leaves, which add a slight crunch and cut through the richness of the keema. Bohris also make dal (lentil) samosas, which are delicacies.

Of the many migrant communities that make up the rich tapestry of Calcutta’s modern history, the Bohra Muslims might not be the most visible, but they are a thriving culture. By some accounts, Calcutta is estimated to have about 5,000 ‘Bohris’. Mostly traders and businessfolk, the earliest settlers arrived in the city from western parts of India in the late 1800s.

4W9JPLkiwS4,Bong Eats,Crispiest Beguni Recipe—Bengali batter-fried brinjals—chop telebhaja recipe,2018-08-03 05:28:48+00:00,"Beguni or begun'er chop is one of the most popular ""telebhaja"" (fried in oil) dishes all over Bengal and many parts of eastern India. Beguni is served as a snack in the evenings with tea. It is also popular as a side with dal-torkari-rice or khichuri. Beguni may be a simple recipe but creating muchmuch-e (crispy) beguni everytime requires an understanding of various factors that go into making the beguni crisp. In this video, we show our personal favourite way of making the batter using besan (gram flour) and rice flour. The proportion between the besan and rice flour in the batter makes a lot of difference in the final product. Also important is the ratio of water to the dry ingredients. As always, we recommend weighing your ingredients to be able to confidently produce a perfect batter every time. In fact, this batter recipe will work for any other kind of besan-based telebhaja too. So, it is a great recipe to commit to memory should a telebhaja emergency ever arise!

jnQgkwVsMgc,Bong Eats,How to Make Better Rotis—The secret behind soft rotis/phulkas that stay soft even when cold,2018-07-27 05:13:39+00:00,"How to make roti: Rooti, or roti, is a relatively new entrant to the Bengali kitchen. Wheat being a staple in the Northern parts of India, rotis, chapatis, and phulkas are the mainstay. In Bengal because the main crop is paddy, the staple has always been rice. It is only in the last 50 years that Bengalis have started eating rotis. Rotis are more popular as breakfast or dinner. For breakfast, rooti is served mashed with milk and a fruit such as banana (doodh-ruti-kola), or with a torkari. For dinner, ruti is usually served with a protein such as egg or chicken curry, or with a thick dal. Another reason for the popularity of rotis in Bengal is its convenience as tiffin or lunchbox item for school or office. Ruti-torkari is less prone to leakage and fewer items are required to eat roti than rice (at least for Bengalis).

This soft alu-peyaj bhaja isn't the most delicious thing one can make with aloo, but it is quick to make and extremely versatile. This dry aloo bhaja can act like a dry alu'r torkari with rooti for breakfast. It can also be served as one of the sides with dal and torkari (vegetables). We would also have it with runny khichuri sometimes on rainy nights. On hot summer afternoons this is what we were served with panta bhaat. 

The whole recipe takes 20 minutes to make and it is a keeper. After all, not all that we eat everyday has to be glamorous or even coveted. Some recipes are just monotonous and sustaining and we love them all the same.

Once you have had great filter coffee, it is nearly impossible to go back to instant coffee. Coffee is a complex subject where every little thing matters--the type of coffee beans (Robusta or Arabica), where it is grown, how it is processed, how it is roasted, how fine or coarse it is ground, by which method it is brewed, at what temperature, and so on. But in this episode we are keeping things simple. This is meant to be an introduction to real coffee--using a basic South Indian coffee filter and how to use the coffee decoction to make a cup of coffee at home.

kCR9zDpou9Y,Bong Eats,Ilish Maachh Bhaja—Hilsa Fish Fried in Mustard Oil—Bengali Fried Fish Recipe,2018-07-06 03:00:01+00:00,"Ilish Bhaja is Ilish in its simplest form. Bengalis love their fried fish, but very few things come close to the fatty Hilsa seasoned with just salt and turmeric, then fried in mustard oil until crunchy. The mustard oil gets flavoured with the rendered fat from the fish, and is then drizzled on top of steaming white rice and served alongside the ilish with some salt and hot green chillies.

Something like this does not really need a recipe, yet, no document on Bengali food would be complete without the simple joys of life like this one. Yes, we love our Ilish Paturi, Ilish Bhapa, Ilish Tel Jhol with Brinjal, but Ilish Bhaja has a place of its own in the heart of a Bengali.

ABcJVlglEXo,Bong Eats,Ilish Bhapa Shorshe Diye—Bengali Recipe of Steamed Hilsa in Mustard-Coconut Paste—Easy Ilish Recipe,2018-06-29 03:03:57+00:00,"COLLAB VIDEO by Hothat Jodi Uthlo Kotha: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0o__wBbDl0
___________________________________
Shorshe lish bhapa (or bhaape) meaning steamed mustard hilsa, is a Bengali recipe of hilsa fish (a type of shad) steamed in a potent mustard, doi (yoghurt) and coconut paste. Even though it looks very polished, it is a fairly easy recipe to execute, requiring few ingredients, no special technique, and very little time. 

It is especially convenient for entertaining guests. You can keep everything ready in a tiffin box, and just as the guests are sitting down for the first course you can put the container to steam. It will be ready by the time the guests are finishing the vegetable courses. You can then bring this to the table and open the lid to reveal the beautiful steaming hilsa while your guests are suitably excited and impressed.

___________SAVE ILISH!____________
There is no fish tastier than Ilish, not to the Bangali. Ilish or hilsa is, however, facing extinction due to high demand and overfishing. While policy initiatives between India and Bangladesh are underway to tackle this alarming situation (hilsa conservation depends a great deal on water flow in the Padma-Meghna and Hooghly-Bhagirathi river systems), we can do our bit too.

6-IQrxibfiI,Bong Eats,Chilli Chicken Recipe—Kolkata Restaurant Style Dry Chilli Chicken—Indo-Chinese Chicken Gravy Recipe,2018-06-22 07:11:12+00:00,"Chilli chicken recipe: Chilli chicken is perhaps the most popular Indo-Chinese dish found both in restaurants and street side stalls. No visit to Calcutta's Chinatowns (especially Tangra) is complete without an order of chilli chicken. The dry chilli chicken works as a snack, appetiser as well as a side. The gravy chilli chicken is more popular as a side to either chowmein or with fried rice. There are various versions of the chilli chicken recipes. While you can play around with the sauces you like in your chilli chicken, most folks will agree that the best chilli chicken has the chicken still crispy when served. With that goal in mind we tested both the wet batter as well as the dry breading technique and finally went with breading. What yielded the crunchiest chicken was Kenji Lopez-Alt's method (https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/04/the-food-lab-bringing-home-general-tsos-chick.html), which he had used in his General Tso's Chicken recipe in Serious Eats Food Lab. Do give this a try and let us know how it goes!

It is a summer speciality as potol are in season now. Doodh potol is made with 'kochi' potol or baby potol that do not yet have overgrown seeds. The vegetable soaks up the curry and becomes soft and juicy. Each potol, when eaten, bursts in your mouth releasing the delicate curry. Do not try and recreate this potol recipe using larger potol—it will not taste very good. This preparation is creamy yet light, and looks incredibly special even though can be put together in less than 30 minutes. A must-have during the summer months.

OPAIFY_4Wrg,Bong Eats,Phirni Recipe—Firni—Perfect Kolkata Mughlai Style Rice Pudding—Ramzan & Eid Special Recipe,2018-06-08 03:40:58+00:00,"Phirni (firni) recipe: after testing various proportions of rice to milk, milk to sugar, as well as testing with different types of rice, we have finally settled on a phirni recipe that is quick and easy to make, but tastes exactly like the phirni we have eaten in our favourite Mughlai eateries in Calcutta such as Aminia, Arsalan, Shiraz, Aliah, Shabir, etc. This phirni is made with very simple ingredients—rice flour, whole milk, sugar and flavouring agents (we are using saffron or zafran in our phirni). Our version is made without any condensed milk or mawa because we found that they don't make any noticeable difference to phirni. We also like our phirni to be creamy and plain, so we have left out any additional garnishes.

Different parts of India have their own types of phirni—Punjabi phirni and Kashmiri phirni are especially well known. This particular style of phirni is popular in Mughlai eateries in Calcutta. No biryani meal is complete without a phirni dessert. Enjoy this recipe and if you give this a try, let us know how it turns out!

What makes the Kolkata biryani special is the unique combination of spices and fragrances used in its preparation. While biryani moshlas used in the Shiraz, Arsalan, Zeeshan, or Aminia kitchens aren't exactly closely guarded secrets (these kitchens have been widely featured in newspapers, magazines, television, and YouTube videos), it is difficult to to gauge the proportions among the spices to achieve balance of flavours. Follow the measurements in this video to recreate biryani masala,  subtle in flavour, which defines a Kolkata mutton biryani.

SbWGXcZTYzg,Bong Eats,Kolkata Mutton Biryani Recipe—Ramzan & Eid Special Recipe—Bengali-Style Mutton Biryani At Home,2018-06-01 10:57:42+00:00,"Kolkata biryani recipe: Kolkatans are truly passionate about their mutton biryani. Kolkata has its distinct style of biryani which is on a par with the best biryanis in India—including Lucknow-style biryani and the Hyderabadi biryani. Kolkata biryani, in spite of the usage of a staggering number of spices, is not spicy. It is subtle and fragrant without being dry. A good Kolkata biryani should be moist and can be eaten on its own—no raita or salan required. This style of biryani is descended from the Lucknow style biryani that came to Calcutta with the exiled Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah (remember Satyajit Ray's ""Satranj Ke Khilari""?). What started with just a handful of restaurants such as Royal India Hotel, Shiraz, and Aminia has become the most widely available and eaten street food in Calcutta. Many new restaurants have sprung up and the competition for excellent biryani in Calcutta is only getting tougher. Our recipe of the Kolkata mutton biryani isn't perfect, but it is very, very close. With some practice, planning and patience this recipe will help you make a very good Calcutta-style biryani at home.

DfXOiwwl5F8,Bong Eats,Beef Chaap—Calcutta-style Mughlai Specialty—Ramzan and Eid Special Recipe,2018-05-25 03:03:40+00:00,"Walk by any joint specialising in serving up Mughlai delicacies in Kolkata and its outskirts and you will most likely find a massive lagan of chaap being tended to right there on the footpath. Chaap is as ubiquitous in Kolkata's Mughlai eateries, big and small, as biryani. Beef chaap is especially popular among aficionados. In this video, we show you how to recreate restaurant-style, tender, melt-in-your-mouth beef chaap, championed by joints such as Asma, Nafeel, Zam Zam, Afreen, Arafat, and their ilk, at home.

Chaap is basically a preparation where thin slices of meat are marinated, usually tenderised, and fried in oil at very low temperature over a long period of time. South Asian cuisines in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan make varying kinds of dry and gravy-laden chaap preparations. The Kolkata chaap in particular has generous amounts of spicy gravy and is served with a drizzling of the oil it is cooked it. Enjoy it with naan, tandoori rooti, roomali rooti, porota, or a plate of warm aromatic biryani.

R0POBxK6tyE,Bong Eats,Aam’er Tok or Amer Ambol–Easy Bengali Light Green Mango Chutney,2018-05-18 02:52:48+00:00,"Aam'er Tok (pronounced ""tawk"") is a recipe for the hot Bengal summers when the mangoes are not ripe yet, and the frequent nor'westers or afternoon storms keep knocking unripe green mangoes off the trees. Bengalis love making all sorts of cooling green mango recipes in these months. Apart from the green mango dals, achaars (pickles) and chutneys, they make an aam'er tok or ambol which is a unique transitional course just after the fish and meat and just before the desserts. Sometimes, on very hot days the ambol or tok can even play the role of the dessert in closing out the meal. 

For this Aam'er Tok recipe remember to select the smaller, more fragrant unripe green mangoes. The large, nearly ripe green mangoes don't have the same tartness, flavour or the texture. This can be cooked very quickly and easily and stored in the fridge for a few weeks. Serve this chilled towards the end of the meal and experience the cool, sweet, savoury and sour liquid of the tok make its way to your soul.

KBGgeBM22BM,Bong Eats,Rabindra Jayanti Special: Bhaat'er Kofta–Rice and Saffron Koftas: Thakurbarir Ranna,2018-05-04 06:25:12+00:00,"This video—bhaat'er kofta or deep-fried rice balls—is part of a series where we commemorate Rabindra Jayanti each year by cooking a recipe from a book written by members of the illustrious Tagore family. These bhaat'er koftas are from 'Amish o Niramish Ahar' (Vol. 1), a well-known Bengali cookbook from the early twentieth century written by Pragyasundari Debi. She was Rabindranath Tagore's niece who religiously tried out and recorded hundreds of recipes, both common and uncommon. 

Fragrant, flavourful and creamy on the inside with a crunchy coating of yoghurt and semolina (sooji) on the outside, these koftas make a great tea-time snack. If they look uncannily similar to the Italian arancini, it is probably because they may be inspired by it. Give this recipe a go—it is quick and easy—and if you have tried any of the other recipes from 'Amish o Niramish Ahar', let us know in the comments.

G4Igr5VwEEQ,Bong Eats,Mochar Ghonto 2 ways—with chola & coconut or chingri—Bengali Vegetarian Recipe of Banana Blossoms,2018-04-27 09:33:50+00:00,"Mocha'r ghonto is special to anyone who has grown up in Bengal. Mocha is the banana blossom. The niramish (vegetarian) mocha'r ghonto with coconut (narkel) and chola (Bengal gram) is loved as much as mocha chingri, garnished with small freshwater prawns. In this video, we show methods of preparing both mocha'r ghonto as well as mocha with chingri. This also includes a very easy, step-by-step guide to cleaning, preparing and cutting mocha. Like any Bengali niramish recipe, this one uses no onion or garlic—the main flavours come from ginger, cumin, ghee and garam masala. Mocha provides a crunchy texture that is a canvas for all these flavours. Give this Bengali recipe of mocha a try. It is not the best looking dish, but once you taste mocha, it will change your life.

RECIPE FOR DAL'ER BORA
-------------------------------------------
1. Soak mosur dal (orange lentils) in water for 30 minutes. Rinse and grind with salt and green chillies using as little water as possible. The grind should be a little coarse to provide boras texture. 

2. Heat oil on medium flame. Once hot, drop little dollops of the dal batter into the oil. Deep-fry until the boras are evenly golden in colour.

qbZRmBc3y9M,Bong Eats,Kachkola’r Kofta’r Dalna—Raw Banana Kofta Curry—Plantain or Green Banana Curry Bengali Recipe,2018-04-20 03:27:23+00:00,"Among the many kolagach (banana plant) products Bengalis have thought to turn into delectable food items, kachkola’r kofta (raw banana kofta) remains an eternal favourite. Kanchkola’r kofta are delicately spiced, deep-fried raw banana fritters. Boiled kachkola are mashed with boiled potatoes, onion paste, ginger, green chillies, and a host of dry spices including bhaja masala, which gives the koftas their distinctive flavour. A little maida (all-purpose flour) binds everything together. This mixture is then portioned, shaped into discs, and dropped in hot oil. 

We like to fry our kachkola’r boras until they are dark brown in colour (as opposed to golden brown). This leads to richer, better tasting koftas, which also don’t break as easily once introduced to the curry. This brings us to the second part of the recipe—the kachkola jhol/dalna. This raw banana or plantain curry is hot, gingery, and slightly sweet. The addition of grated coconut gives the curry body in addition to a nice texture. 

These green banana koftas, once fried and completely cooled, freeze very well. We usually make a large batch and freeze half for up to 30 days. Be sure to store them in an airtight box or bag. The day before you want to make the curry, move them from the freezer to the fridge and let them defrost slowly. Oh, and also do not discard the green banana peels while making this kachkola recipe, as you could turn them into a delicious, fiery khosha chachchari.

f4uIoGNFX2k,Bong Eats,Chingri Malaikari Recipe—Bengali Prawn Malai Curry—Bengali Prawn Curry—Noboborsho Special,2018-04-13 06:27:47+00:00,"Chingri malaikari is an iconic Bengali prawn curry made by cooking large tiger prawns (bagda chingri) or giant freshwater prawns (golda chingri) in a super-subtle, super-creamy coconut-milk sauce. Don’t be fooled by the elegant appearance of this well-loved Bengali treat—chingri malaikari looks deceptively complicated to cook, when in reality it is easier to make than even chicken or egg curry!

The name of this chingri macher recipe bears somewhat of a double meaning. ‘Malai’ meaning ‘cream’ recalls the coconut-milk base in which the prawns are cooked. However, this prawn recipe seems to have made its way into Bengali kitchens through contact with Malaysian traders; so ‘malaikari’ is actually ‘Malay’ curry, which over time became ‘malai’ curry. 

In this detailed video we show you how to prepare a gorgeous, creamy chingri malaikari, starting with a walkthrough of how you can clean and devein giant tiger (bagda) or freshwater (golda) prawns. With this step-by-step recipe video at your disposal, there is no reason why you should hop over to your nearest Bhojohori Manna to satiate your chingri malaikari cravings!

This is the main rice dish of choice for any special occasion. Among the side dishes served with basanti pulao, kosha mangsho [video linked below] is the most popular. Kosha mangsho and polao is a favourite combination among Bengalis. While there are many other kinds of polao, made with different types of fruits, nuts, meat or fish, this one has become the most popular, featuring prominently on the menus of Bengali specialty restaurants such as Bhojohori Manna, Kewpie's, etc.

Ia2MzLxJhno,Bong Eats,Shukto Recipe—Bengali Appetizer of Stewed Vegetables—Bengali Special Lunch Recipe,2018-03-30 08:44:13+00:00,"The most popular kind of Bengali shukto is the mild, comforting stew packed with a variety of vegetables, most notably potatoes, sweet potatoes, bitter gourd (korola), green bananas (kachkola), raw papaya (pepe), brinjal, drumsticks (shojne), and flat beans (sheem). Even though this form of shukto has in recent times come to be associated with 'traditional' biyebaris and other nemontonno feasts, and is also quite sought after at restaurants such as Bhojohori Manna, this is only one of the many different kinds of shukto recipes that are part of the Bengali cuisine. 

By definition, a shukto is a mild, sometimes bitter, milky curry that is eaten after shaak (greens) and before dal (lentils). As such, it is not the name of a single dish, as is commonly believed, but an entire category of curries (like dalna or ghonto) in its own right. Lau'er shukto (made with bottle gourd), shosha'r shukto (cucumber), and dhula shaak'er shukto are some of the other kinds of shukto known today, albeit among few families. Within the structure of the Bengali meal, shukto is eaten right at the beginning. It is said to stimulate the appetite and prepare the palate for the oncoming spicier courses.

Bengalis consume all parts of the banana plant in one form or the other and green banana recipes are some of the most loved. Bengal, having seen devastating famines as well as the horrors of Partition, has had to be frugal and resourceful when it comes to food. Once you taste this kachkola'r khosha chochchori you will wonder why anyone would consider throwing away the peels when making a kachkola recipe! It is that delicious. So next time you're making green banana kofta (kachkola'r kofta) or kachkola'r torkari, remember to preserve the peels! We hope you give this easy green bananas recipe a try.

'Bhaate' are a type of frugal Bengali dishes where vegetables are boiled along with the day's rice. Once cooked, the boiled vegetables are fished out, and then may be mashed, seasoned with salt and garnished with pungent mustard oil. A tiny helping of this is served just at the beginning of the meal to be eaten with rice. This opens up the palette to the other more extravagant dishes that are coming up. Uchhe or bitter gourd is also eaten during the spring when the cold winter turns to the hot summers in Bengal.

Like most Bengali dal recipes, this one is easy and straightforward enough to take no more than 15 to 20 minutes of your time.

iG-2JrN9Ej4,Bong Eats,Omelette Curry Bengali Recipe—Mamlette’r Jhol—Quick & Easy Indian Egg Recipe,2018-02-23 04:32:09+00:00,"CORRECTION: At 1:55 the oven temperature should be 180°C / 350°F. Apologies for the error!

Omelette’er jhol is a Bengali spicy egg curry prepared with omelette instead of regular boiled, pan-fried eggs. Although Bengalis love their egg curry, the ‘mamlette’er jhol’ occupies a special place in their hearts. It is quick to make and requires ingredients that are usually on hand, or easy to acquire in a pinch. What makes the egg omelette curry special, though, is the promise of a warm plate of rice with a flavourful, spicy curry-soaked omelette and juicy potatoes. 

This recipe shows you how to prepare extra-spongy, fluffy omelette. If you feel like taking your dim’er omelette’er jhol to the next level, you will not regret the extra effort in preparing these light, airy omelettes. But this recipe works just as well if you decide to make a regular, pan-fried omelette. So whether in a hurry, or tired from a long, rough day, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a more soothing and well-rounded meal than ‘mamlette’er jhol’ and rice.

r6VFKDdjohg,Bong Eats,Aloo Chokha/Alu Bhorta Recipe—Alu Bhate Recipe—Bengali Recipe of Spicy Mashed Potato,2018-02-16 04:31:02+00:00,"There is an entire category of Bengali dishes, the preparation of which involves boiling / steaming vegetables, greens, or even certain kinds of fish, and then mashing them by hand with some sharp flavours derived perhaps from onions, garlic and chillies. This category is called the ‘bhorta’, and is admittedly more popular within the Bangladeshi branches of Bengali cooking than it is within the West Bengal ones. The mode of preparation is so simplistic—requiring only a handful of basic, affordable ingredients, and very little effort—that every cuisine has its take on the bhorta in some form or another (the Bihari aloo chokha, Bengali aloo sheddho or aloo bhaate, and the North Indian aloo / baingan / chicken bharta come to mind).

So an aloo bhorta, as you may have guessed, is a mash of boiled potatoes, and fried onions, garlic, and chillies. In this recipe, we’ve used both dried red chillies and green chillies, as well as some raw mustard oil for an added kick. Although this preparation doesn’t really warrant a recipe, no compendium of Bengali cooking would be complete without this quintessential comfort food. The next time you are tempted to reach for the take-out menu after a busy work day, be sure to remember to put together a simple meal of steaming hot rice, dal, and the simple aloo bhorta.

-iJY01jwRs4,Bong Eats,Chingri Kumro’r Dalna/Jhol—Bengali Prawn Curry with Pumpkin—Chingri Macher Recipe,2018-02-09 03:41:24+00:00,"This Bengali prawn and pumpkin curry, known as kumro-chingri’r jhol or kumro-chingri’r dalna, is a light preparation, best made with small-sized (7–10 cm), fresh/live prawns (chingri mach). The curry also contains pumpkin (kumro) and potatoes in chunky cubes, which get juicy from being laden with the flavourful jhol. This is a Bengali-style dalna (curry), so it contains the usual suspects—whole garam masala, ginger, cumin, red chilli, and turmeric. However, the proportions of the spices here is dialled down to a great extent, so as not to overpower the flavour of the prawns. 

This kumro-chingri recipe is so quick to put together that it can be prepared on busy weekdays to go with some steaming, hot rice. If you like the idea of a hearty Bengali-style prawn curry, with some nutritious pumpkin thrown in for good measure, you must give this recipe a try.

VjVYttymMTA,Bong Eats,"Chilli Pork—Spicy Stir-Fried Double-Cooked Pork Belly—Blue Poppy, Calcutta Style—Indian Pork Recipe",2018-02-02 04:52:19+00:00,"Chilli pork is one of the most versatile dishes in that it can just as easily double as a side dish to go with tingmo, rice, fried rice, or noodles, as function as a standalone snack or appetiser. It can be cooked in several different ways. In fact, nearly all East Asian and Southeast Asian cultures have variations of this popular dish. In India, besides the Tibetan, and Nepali versions, the Goan, Mangalorean and Kerala-style chilli pork are well known, and who among us doesn’t enjoy the dry, dark Coorgi chilli pork?

We like our chilli pork juicy, where stir-fried pork slices are accompanied with hot green chillies in every bite. We’re using the pork belly as it is fatty, but you could also use the leaner shoulder. This simple recipe leads to twice-cooked chilli pork. The meat is first boiled until tender and then stir-fried. This recipe is also reminiscent of the chilli pork on the menus of several Chinese restaurants in Calcutta.

doLrVyqkiLg,Bong Eats,Palong Shak Ghonto—Palang Saag Bengali Recipe—Spinach Mixed Vegetable Curry—Indian Spinach Dishes,2018-01-26 07:18:08+00:00,"Palong shaak'er ghonto is a kind of panchmishali torkari in that it uses an assortment of vegetables—potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, moolo (radish), sheem (broad beans), and brinjal—besides the spinach (palong/palak). As the illustrious roll-call of ingredients suggests, this palong shaak recipe brings together flavours, textures (and don’t forget nutrients) from a variety of sources. This particular Bengali vegetarian preparation is a herbivore’s delight, although it is enjoyed by omnivores in equal measure. What’s more, the spinach curry we show in this video is several times more tasty than the regular palong shaak bhaji. 

This dish is a ‘ghonto’, a dry curry. Here, the vegetables are steamed in their own juices until they are soft, exactly like in panchmishali torkari. There’s not much to this recipe in terms of spices or technique. Sparsely spiced with just turmeric and cumin powder, this recipe relies on salt and sugar to help draw the moisture and flavours from the vegetables. They cook on low heat, covered, for about 40 to 45 minutes (don’t forget to stir regularly to prevent burning), enabling the juices from the veggies to mingle together to produce a unique-tasting dish.
 
When wintry greens are crisp and in season, there is no better use for spinach than making this delicious (did we say nutritious?) palong shaak’er ghonto, which can be served with steaming rice and dal.

hbmQC68tVec,Bong Eats,Tomato Chutney Recipe Bengali Style–Khejur Amsotto Tomato Chatni–Sweet-Sour Bengali Chutney Recipe,2018-01-19 03:46:02+00:00,"There’s no better after-meal treat than the sweet-tangy Bengali tomato chutney with a scattering of khejur (dates), aamshotto (mango pulp candy), raisins and cashew. Extremely popular on biyebari (wedding feast) menus, as well as in pujo bhogs (offerings) where it is served alongside khichuri (khichdi), the syrupy tomato-khejur’er chutney is slurped up with crunchy fried papad. In the systematic progression that is the Bengali course-governed meal set-up, chutney helps the eater transition from the main course of fish or meat on to full-blown dessert.

The sweet Bengali tomato chutney recipe is so simple that it beggars belief—including prep time, it takes under 30 minutes to make! With ripe red tomatoes in abundance, winters are the perfect time for preparing it in large batches. Feed a large group of people, or savour this long-lasting tomato chutney (if divided up and stored in small airtight containers in the fridge, it can last for as long as 3–4 months) by yourself over time, either way do give this a try!

2ARM9JhfXsg,Bong Eats,Nolen Gurer Payesh Recipe—Khejur Patali Gurer Payesh—Payesh Recipe with Jaggery—Bengali Sweet Recipe,2018-01-12 03:47:05+00:00,"Getting the nolen gur’er payesh recipe right is one of life’s most rewarding experiences. A good payesh (Bengali rice pudding) is one with a rich, creamy, silky texture and just the right amount of sweetness. Also known as ‘kherjur patali gur’er payesh’ because it uses date palm (khejur) jaggery in solid form (patali) as a sweetener, this Bengali sweet recipe can double as a snack and an after-meal dessert. Whether you call it ‘payesh’ or ‘payasam’ or ‘kheer’, this is one of those quintessential Indian sweet dishes that transcends cultures and cuisines. 

Nolen gur’er payesh (rice pudding with date palm jaggery) is made by boiling rice and milk together to produce a creamy reduction, and sweetening it with nolen gur. It is a Bengali winter specialty since nolen gur is available during the season. Used in a wide variety of Bengali sweet dishes during the winter months, nolen gur brings a depth of flavour and smell, in addition to mellow sweetness, to whatever dish it is added. 

The key ingredients required for making a good payesh are fragrant gobindobhog rice (‘notun aatop chaal’—new, freshly harvested, non-parboiled rice), full fat milk, and good quality nolen gur. The milk to rice ratio is quite high in this recipe (1 litre milk to 50g rice). The fat in whole milk lends creaminess to the payesh and starch in ‘new’ rice helps thicken it. In case you can’t find gobindobhog rice where you live, the ‘kalijira’ or ‘jeera samba’ varieties will also do in a pinch.

oTrxOqVd7-I,Bong Eats,Parshe Macher Jhal Shorshe Recipe Begun Diye | Parshe Macher Jhol | Bengali Parshe Fish Curry Recipe,2018-01-05 03:28:35+00:00,"Shorshe diye parshe macher jhol (or parshe macher jhal) is a simple and delectable Bengali fish curry. Here, fresh parshe is simmered in a potent and flavourful mustard gravy. This Bengali fish-curry recipe is easy to prepare, insanely delicious, and requires only a handful of ingredients. The star of the show is, of course, fresh parshe. A freshwater catch with a soft sheen, parshe (a kind of mullet) is identifiable by its small, triangular mouth and slender shape. The fish is soft, flaky, and sweet to the taste—all of which are perfectly complemented by the fiery, potent flavours from the mustard gravy. 

This parshe macher jhal recipe is rather simple. The only finicky bit is grinding mustard seeds to a smooth paste until completely non-grainy. We’re using a mix of yellow and black mustard for a balance of flavour and sharpness. Besides fresh parshe, this recipe uses dal’er bori (sun-baked lentil dumplings) and brinjal, both of which soak up the flavourful curry, and provide a contrast of tastes and textures to this warm, comforting parshe macher jhol.

Prepared in Bengal during the winter months using newly harvested baby potatoes or ‘notun aloo’, aloo dum is best enjoyed with luchi, koraishuti’r kochuri, polao, fried rice, or porota. This simple recipe shows you how to make Bengali niramish aloo dum, the vegetarian version. Since it is prepared without the use of onion or garlic, it can be served as 'bhog'. 

This Bengali niramish aloo dum recipe is not strictly traditional, but our take on it. It produces juicy aloo’r dom with a dry gravy that is rich and indulgent, and ready to be mopped up with a piece of light, fluffy luchi.

VOKgeZMwrv4,Bong Eats,Vegetable Chop|Veg Chop Kolkata-style|Vegetable Cutlet|Beetroot recipe|Easy Bengali Snacks Recipe,2017-12-22 04:30:04+00:00,"In this recipe for Bengali vegetable chop (sometimes called beet chop or veg cutlet), we recreate the popular and beloved Kolkata street food. The main ingredient of this easy Bengali veg recipe is beetroot, which lends the chop its characteristic vibrant maroon colour. Besides that, this recipe also uses a unique blend of spices. Follow this video to learn how to make a Kolkata-style vegetable chop of the perfect texture and flavour.

Bengalis look forward to nothing more on winter evenings than a batch of hot-off-the-oil fried snack and a cup of sweet, milky tea. One such snack is the delicious (may we even say nutritious?) Kolkata-style vegetable chop. Best championed by patrons of roadside shacks, ‘telebhaja dokan’, and cabins, this popular and easy-to-make Bengali vegetarian snack is enjoyed with a simple salad of onions and cucumbers, and a dollop of kasundi. Full of the goodness of the seasonal beetroots and carrots, both of which are winter vegetables in Bengal, the vegetable chop (or veg cutlet) is crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and rather sweet to taste. It is a landmine of flavour and texture, which come from the veggies, spices, and nuts used.

The classic Calcutta fruitcake—a fixture in many homes around Christmas-time—is a rum-soaked, fruit-and-nut encrusted indulgence. Fruitcakes are a big deal in Calcutta. Come Christmas, shops spring up all over the city selling Christmas cakes, or ‘Borodin’er cake’. The tradition of baking, gifting, and eating plum cakes around Christmas is an old one, popularised in Kolkata by bakers like Nahoum and Saldanha to a wider section of the population. Families celebrating Christmas soak their dried fruits weeks in advance and book their slots with their local bakers for community baking of their cakes. Making a Christmas fruitcake at home is easy, to say nothing of rewarding. Such fruitcakes contain their characteristic booze-soaked fruits, are full of textured nuts, all of which can be customised in dozens of ways. In this recipe, we show you how to bake an indulgent Christmas fruitcake at home.

Order a plate of momos and it will most likely be accompanied with a bowl of hot momo soup. It is a clear broth, comforting—you can even call it fortifying—and always complimentary. 

The momo soup recipe is the result of trying to use up throwaway items such as animal or bird carcass and bones, vegetable shavings, and so on. Normally, you would serve pork soup with pork momos, beef soup with beef momos, and so on. Here, we show you how to make momo soup that is potent and flavourful, with tips that will help produce a clear, non-cloudy, broth.

This broth can also be used as stock in the base of other, more elaborate soups, gravies, curries, etc.

In this video, we bring you a steamed pork momo recipe with easy-to-follow instructions on how to make momos at home. Whether you are looking for easy recipes for pork momo filling, hot momo chutney, the hearty momo soup, or just a tutorial on how you can prepare and roll the momo dough and pleat, crimp and shape your own momos, we have the complete package for you. 

This recipe calls for fatty minced pork (at least 30 to 50 per cent fat). If you are shopping for pork in Calcutta, just ask for ‘momo pork keema’ at shops such as UP Cold Storage (New Market) or Chaman’s (Beckbagan), and the butchers will be able to give you a mince with the ideal fat to meat ratio! The pork shoulder and pork belly are good cuts for sourcing momo meat from.

🤔 WHAT’S UP WITH MSG?

Recent studies have shown that MSG (Mono-sodium Glutamate)—often referred to by its brand name Ajinamoto—is not a harmful substance. It is a naturally occurring salt of sodium (just like table salt) derived from seaweeds that quickly and cheaply lends your dish an umami flavour. Glutamate salts are present in everyday food including tomatoes, mushrooms, meat, milk, cheese, and even human breast milk. Some people may be allergic to MSG—just like people are allergic to eggs, gluten, etc. If you are one of those people, certainly stay away from food that contains MSG, including all packaged chips, soups, instant ramens, etc. But for the vast majority of us, MSG is safe to eat. You can read more about it at the links below:
1. https://www.seriouseats.com/ask-the-food-lab-the-truth-about-msg
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCy_0IN_vAE

GNA1tpQ7dr0,Bong Eats,Momo wrapper | How prepare the dough and roll a momo wrap,2017-11-17 05:14:03+00:00,"Making momo wrappers is very easy, not least because it involves only four ingredients, including water! The trick is to make a stiff dough, knead it extremely well, and rest it in a plastic bag. The dough then becomes smooth and ready to be portioned and filled with a momo filling of your choice. In this video, we take you through the steps of kneading the dough, and then, most importantly, rolling out the wrappers to the perfect diameter and thickness. Since the edges of a momo are crimped together, we need to ensure that the sides of the wrapper are thin so that they cook at the same time as the rest of the momo. The rolling method shown in this video is a traditional one, which ensures that your momo covering turns out soft and perfectly cooked no matter what you fill it with!

With the month-long festivities of the Pujo season behind them, Calcuttans (individuals, families, and bakeries alike) gear up for the next set of celebrations—Christmas and New Year! If you go to New Market right after Kali Pujo, that's when the shops selling ingredients for fruitcakes start getting their supplies. 

Bong Eats turns one this week (on November 4)! As a celebration of the year gone by we are thrilled to share a Christmas cake recipe that we've been tweaking and personalising for the past seven years! 

This is a Christmas cake recipe in two parts. Part 1 takes you through the process of preparing and soaking the dried fruits for the fruitcake in alcohol and Part 2 will show you how you can bake the actual cake. 

So, if you're planning on baking a cake this Christmas, go soak the dried fruits now, and join us again on December 15 for the baking instructions!

KUUOwNouiPA,Bong Eats,How to Make Soft Paneer/Chhana at Home,2017-10-27 03:00:00+00:00,"Paneer is one of the most neutral ingredients in Indian cooking, which makes it ideal for use in a wide array of curries. A good paneer must be well formed and not crumbly. Its structure shouldn't be too tight, otherwise it will become tough and not absorb any curry. 

While paneer is especially adored among aficionados of some branches of north Indian cuisine in particular—it is the vegetarian's delight—its close cousin 'chhana' (or 'chhena') holds a special place in Bengali cooking. From being the base for all manner of Bengali sweets (sondesh, roshogolla, anyone?), it is also used to make chhana'r torkari, a curry with mildly spiced chhana koftas, which is a beloved delicacy. 

Of course, cubes of fresh paneer are also used in Bengali curries. In this video, we show you how to form and cut paneer perfectly, and also link you to our special recipe for paneer'er dalna in the end!

The word ""kosha"" is similar in meaning to ""bhuna"" which means to slowly cook a gravy over low flame for a very long time leading to a rich, brown gravy and melt-in-the-mouth mutton pieces. It is worth pointing out that in Bengal, or India for that matter, mutton is commonly used to refer to a goat's meat. Mutton kosha (kosha mangsho) is served with Paratha or with Polao. It tastes great even with plain rice. One of the most famous shops selling this style of mutton kosha is Golbari in Shyambazar, Calcutta. While we are not certain that our version of mutton kosha is exactly the same as the Golbari's, but this certainly tastes very good.

Paneer'er dalna (Bengali paneer curry with potatoes and peas) is infused with the flavours of ginger, cumin, garam masala and ghee. This recipe also uses capsicum, which imparts a lovely peppery aroma to the dish. Here, fresh cubes of homemade paneer are shallow-fried and then added to the curry and cooked until they are soft and juicy. This is a very quick paneer recipe, that is prepared using no onion or garlic and is served with rice and dal, or with light vegetable polao or with luchi.

ZveiVet2ENk,Bong Eats,Ghugni Recipe Bengali Style | Bengali Snack of Curried Yellow Peas | Kolkata Street Food | Chotpoti,2017-10-06 03:00:00+00:00,"Ghugni is one of the most beloved of Bengali snacks. It is a dish of curried whole-yellow peas or motor (matar) dal. A very similar dish is also known as Chotpoti in Bangladesh. A good ghugni is one in which the motor dal is well-cooked, but remains whole. The key is to not overboil the dal. The consistency also needs be just right—slurpy but never watery. With just about 180 kcal per serving, you'd be hard-pressed to find an evening snack more filling, healthy AND delicious than this. 

Serve it piping hot this Bijoya with a garnish of bhaja masala, onions, green chillies and tamarind pulp.

It takes its whimsical name from its twisty-lacy structure. Also known as 'kamranga nimki' after the shape of the fruit by the same name, this deep-fried shortcrust pastry is characterised by its elegant spindle shape. A perfect nimki is not chewy but crisp; it breaks with a satisfying snap. In this video, we show you how to achieve nimki of the desired shape, colour, texture, and of course, flavour. It is best enjoyed with a cup of hot milky tea.

ENoDRJZroI4,Bong Eats,Chicken Cutlet or Fowl Cutlet Recipe—Calcutta Style | Durga Pujo Special | Kolkata Street Food,2017-09-08 04:40:27+00:00,"Chicken cutlet (or fowl cutlet as it is referred to in Kolkata) is one of the city's most beloved snacks. No cabin menu is complete without it. A cutlet, similar to a schnitzel, is made by seasoning a thinned slice of meat and coating it with eggs and bread crumbs. Our version, which is a recreation of the widely popular cabin-style chicken cutlet of Kolkata, is made from minced chicken. 

A good chicken cutlet should be crispy on the outside with a flavourful filling of chicken on the inside. The crust should have a gorgeous, even brown colour. And finally, it is the iconic diamond shape which defines the Kolkata chicken cutlet. In this recipe, we give you tips and tricks to reproduce a cutlet with all of the abovementioned characteristics.

84iZjEzqpRE,Bong Eats,"Kolkata Egg Roll Recipe | Durga Pujo Special | Calcutta Style Egg ""Kathi"" Roll | Kolkata Street Food",2017-09-01 03:00:00+00:00,"Egg roll is not strictly a kathi roll (more on that later). Yet, it is Kolkata's most popular street food. Folks in Calcutta will happily eat egg rolls for lunch, snack, or dinner. In this recipe we show you the best way to make a dough for the ""kathi"" roll that yields a flaky yet soft paratha for the roll. We also give you a couple of variations on the filling.

Although the term kathi roll is indiscriminately used now for all edibles that have a wrap and a filling, it is not accurate. A kathi roll has a fried, flaky, paratha wrap, and a filling of meat skewered on a kathi (or stick). The egg roll, however delicious, doesn't have a filling cooked on a kathi. So, it is not a kathi roll.

While producing good kababs generally requires special grilling, charring or tandoori techniques, shami kabab can be easily prepared at home with no special equipment.

Aloo paratha is a type of stuffed Indian flatbread, that is quick and easy to make, and is very filling. When made at home the calories in a paratha can be kept under 400 kcal (our recipe has 385 kcal) which is very reasonable for a full-sized lunch or dinner. Aloo paratha, or as a Bengali would call it, alu porota, is also an excellent recipe for tiffin or lunchbox for kids, or adults, or for carrying during travel. Aloo paratha, being very dry, keeps well for a long time, and for this reason it is an integral part of the menu during Indian train journeys, where a whole family can be seen devouring stacks of paratha with achar. Parathas or parottas form a very important part of the cuisine of South Asia, including Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.

h5EloI7HDZc,Bong Eats,Khichuri | Bhoger Khichuri | Bengali Khichuri or Khichri Recipe,2017-07-07 03:00:02+00:00,"Khichuri is one of those rare dishes that effortlessly strides the boundary between what’s considered ‘ordinary’ and ‘special’ when it comes to cooking. The Bengali variant of the ever-pervasive South Asian ‘khichdi’, made with nutty, roasted moong dal and fragrant gobindobhog rice, khichuri ranges from mild, runny, and carefully spiced for when you are under the weather, to steaming and slurpy for those wistful rainy days, to the thick, gorgeous, ghee-laden offering made to your favourite goddesses during pujo. In this recipe, we take you, step by step, through the entire process of producing the perfect bhog'er khichuri, ideal also for an evening meal during the monsoons.

MCBQ6UFUrP0,Bong Eats,Lau Shukto | Easiest Bengali Shukto Recipe,2017-06-30 03:00:01+00:00,"Lau Shukto, or shukta, made with bottle gourd, is a mild, creamy, Bengali appetiser served for lunch. Shukto is not just one dish. Like Bengali dalna, or ghonto, it is a type of preparation. Shukto usually has a bitter element—achieved sometimes using bitter vegetables, at other times through bitter spices such as methi (fenugreek) or mustard. But it is always mild (never hot, sour, or spicy) and usually creamy—that comes from either milk, or poppy seed paste, or mustard paste. Shukto is always served for lunch. This is one of the easiest shukto recipes out there.

As the name suggests, 'tel' or mustard oil is an important component of the base of the curry. In such preparations, mustard oil is used twice—once while cooking and at the end for garnish. This intensifies the flavour of the curry. Potol'er tel jhol is a delicacy. This recipe is made with small or kochi potol (pointed gourd or parwal). The baby potol soak up the jhol and become plump and juicy, making for a perfectly delicious, yet light, summer torkari.

Like the more popular haleem found in Calcutta during Ramzan, khichro is made by slowly cooking meat and grains together till the meat falls off the bone. Khichro is a special dish, being most prominently consumed communally on the tenth day of Muharram by Bohris across the globe, but it is also a very homely preparation, eaten throughout the year. It is deceptively light. In spite of the fact that a lot of onions, spices, meat, milk, and ghee goes into its preparation, it is, underneath all that, a very hearty porridge of various kinds of grains. Khichro is distinctive in that it is pale in colour; it doesn’t make use of turmeric powder, chilli powder, jeera powder, and other such spices. Apart from meat, its main ingredient is broken wheat (dalia can also be used).

Kumro'r jhal It is extremely easy to make (it doesn’t require you to spend several minutes sauteing spices) and can be knocked out in under 30 minutes. If you do not have unripe or green pumpkin on hand, butter squash will work well too.

A jhal is a type of Bengali curry characterised by the sharpness of its flavours, unlike its close cousin, the jhol, which is usually more mellow. This recipe, kumro’r jhal, is defined by the heat and aroma that comes from freshly crushed green chillies and kaalo jeere. Here, these are not only used as phoron, but also pasted and added to the curry itself. Apart from that, this unusual jhal recipe also makes use of coconut paste, some milk, and a pinch of flour, all of which render a light, yet creamy, gravy.

This dish benefits from a low-and-slow cooking method, which really helps draw out all the flavours of the lau. The vegetable is to be cut into about 3-mm-wide matchsticks. Larger pieces will not only fail to yield curry of the desired texture, but will also prevent the seasoning and spices from entering the lau. Throughout the cooking process, keep the heat low and the pan covered. Stir occasionally to ensure that the lau doesn’t stick to the pan. In this version of the lau’er ghonto, besides the usual suspects (ginger, cumin powder, garam masala, etc.), we have also added some roasted moong dal and fried dal’er bori. Both these lend the preparation an amazing nutty undertone, along with a subtle bit of crunch. This dish can be absolutely delightful if prepared right.

Even after two centuries, the Tagores define every aspect of what it means to be a Bengali—be it music, literature, art, philosophy, politics, or food. With Rabindranath’s birth anniversary coming up on 25 Boishak (9 May), and given the bard’s love for kababs of all kinds, we thought of recreating this unusual take on the wildly popular Indian snack, dahi vada.

A refreshing Bengali dal recipe: As spring turns to summer in the lower-Gangetic plains, people start preparing for the oppressive heat of the months to come. Cooling foods slowly start getting incorporated into the diet to combat the rising temperatures. But perhaps nothing signals the arrival of spring in Bengal than the kalboishakhi—spells of late-afternoon thunderstorms that are localized to the region. One byproduct of this north-westerly cyclone is that it causes a lot of mangoes to prematurely fall off trees. While that is not good news for ardent lovers of this fleshy, tropical fruit, it gives us an opportunity to prepare a rather delightful tok dal out of the unripe, sour, green mangoes.

Katla machh bhaja is a biyebari staple. The reason this dish occupies a special position on wedding menus is because the tender, flaky, relatively bone-free pieces of sweetwater carp make for delicious and easy consumption. Biyebari’r machh bhaja is characterised by an extra-crunchy exterior, one that almost crackles when broken into. While fish fried in homes is seasoned with a sprinkling of basic salt and turmeric, caterers use ingredients such as arrowroot powder and corn flour to absorb excess moisture and thicken the marinade. Deep-frying the fish (another biyebari trick) at the correct temperature allows for the development of an even, golden crust.

Along with ghee, it may also be used as garnish for several vegetarian preparations. The Bengali garam masala and shahi garam masala are both must-haves in the Bengali kitchen. But if you must pick just one, go the extra mile and keep a small reserve of the shahi version in your arsenal. You’ll be surprised at its transformative powers.

This recipe, pabda machh’er tel jhol, is a delicacy in Bengali cooking. ‘Tel jhol’ is the name given to a light curry, which is infused with kaalo jeere, green chillies, and mustard oil. Because it is sparsely spiced, this style of curry doesn’t overpower the star ingredient—the fish—but lets it shine on its own.

If you can’t find radhuni where you live, cumin seeds make an acceptable substitute for it.

It is caramelized and sweet, with the most wonderful texture ever. Making kheer can be tricky. The milk needs to be stirred constantly and prevented from burning.

UkzICnqYMrY,Bong Eats,How to Cook the Perfect Rice,2016-12-16 03:30:00+00:00,"How to cook perfect rice without a rice cooker: Rice is Bengal’s staple carbohydrate. Grown in vast quantities in paddy fields across the region, rice is eaten in various forms—boiled, steamed, puffed, or beaten. While the keeper of the Bengali kitchen might break out the precious gobindobhog for polao, payesh, or khichuri, and the basmati for biryani, it is the sheddho bhaat that is piled onto plates on an everyday basis. Sheddho bhaat, or parboiled rice, is named after the technique used to separate the grain from the husk. This process is said to enhance the nutritional profile of the grain and make it easier to digest. 

In this video, we show you how a few simple techniques can get you perfectly cooked, fluffy, pearly white rice. Enjoy it with a bowl of steaming dal and a bhaja, with your favourite mangsher jhol, or with just a sliver of ghee and salt—the possibilities are endless.

Making mughlai paratha is not difficult, but it does take a fair bit of planning. Here, we take you through the steps and show you how to make Calcutta's favourite cabin-style dish.
